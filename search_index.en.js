You will open the provided source code file and upload it to the UNO R3 controller board using a USB 2.0 Type A to USB 2.0 Type B Cable to blink the Arduino's built-in LED.\nRequirements:&nbsp;\n\nArduino IDE (Arduino IDE 2 was used for this document)\nArduino UNO R3 or Elegoo UNO R3 Board\n(1) x USB 2.0 Type A to USB 2.0 Type B Cable\n\nDatasheets:&nbsp;\n\nArduino UNO R3 Datasheet\nELEGOO UNO R3 Datasheet\n\nDownloading and installing the Arduino IDE 2\n\nSOURCE:\nArduino.cc Downloading and installing the Arduino IDE 2\n\nA quick guide on how to install the IDE 2 on your operating system.\nYou can easily download the editor from the Arduino Software page.\nRequirements\n\nWindows - Win 10 and newer, 64 bits\nLinux - 64 bits\nMac OS X - Version 10.14: \"Mojave\" or newer, 64 bits\n\nThe Arduino IDE 2&nbsp;\nThe Arduino IDE 2 is an open-source project. It is a big step from its sturdy predecessor, Arduino IDE 1.x, and comes with revamped UI, improved board &amp; library manager, debugger, autocomplete feature and much more.\nDownload the Editor&nbsp;\nDownloading the Arduino IDE 2 is done through the Arduino Software page. Here you will also find information on the other editors available to use.\nInstallation&nbsp;\nWindows&nbsp;\nTo install the Arduino IDE 2 on a Windows computer, simply run the file downloaded from the software page.\n\nRunning the installation file.\nFollow the instructions in the installation guide. The installation may take several minutes.\n\nInstructions for installing the IDE 2\nYou can now use the Arduino IDE 2 on your Windows computer!\nmacOS&nbsp;\nTo install the Arduino IDE 2 on a macOS computer, simply copy the downloaded file into your application folder.\n\nInstallation on macOS.\nYou can now use the Arduino IDE 2 on your macOS computer!\nLinux&nbsp;\nTo install the Arduino IDE 2 on Linux, first download the AppImage 64 bits (X86-64) from the Arduino Software page.\nBefore we can launch the editor, we need to first make it an executable file. This is done by:\n\nYou can now double click the file to launch the Arduino IDE 2 on your Linux machine. In case you cannot run the AppImage file, make sure that FUSE is installed on your system.\nIn Ubuntu (&gt;= 22.04):&nbsp;\n\nIn Fedora&nbsp;\n\nSee instructions for installing FUSE on your distribution here.\nTo enable the Arduino IDE to access the serial port and upload code to your board, the following rule can be added to /etc/udev/rules.d/99-arduino.rules.\n\nSystems Verification Test&nbsp;\nDownload the Arduino source code file (also known as a sketch) Lab0SystemVerificationTest.ino and save it to your computer.\n\nPrinciple&nbsp;\nThe UNO R3 board has rows of connectors along both sides that are used to connect to several electronic devices and plug-in 'shields' that extends its capability.\nIt also has a single LED that you can control from your sketches. This LED is built onto the UNO R3 board and is often referred to as the 'L' LED as this is how it is labeled on the board.\n\nYou may find that your UNO R3 board's 'L' LED already blinks when you connect it to a USB plug. This is because the boards are generally shipped with the 'Blink' sketch pre-installed.\nWe will reprogram the UNO R3 board with our own Blink sketch and then change the rate at which it blinks.\nThe time has now come to put that connection to the test and program your UNO R3 board.\nAttach your Arduino board to your computer with the USB cable.\nOpen the file Lab0_SystemVerificationTest.ino that you downloaded with Arduino IDE 2\nHow to upload a sketch with the Arduino IDE 2&nbsp;\n\nSOURCE:\nArduino.cc How to upload a sketch with the Arduino IDE 2\n\nIn the Arduino environment, we write sketches that can be uploaded to Arduino boards. In this tutorial, we will go through how to select a board connected to your computer, and how to upload a sketch to that board, using the Arduino IDE 2.\nYou can easily download the editor from the Arduino Software page.\nYou can also follow the downloading and installing the Arduino IDE 2 tutorial for more detailed guide on how to install the editor.\nRequirements&nbsp;\n\nArduino IDE 2 installed.\n\nVerify vs Upload&nbsp;\nThere are two main tools when uploading a sketch to a board: verify and upload. The verify tool simply goes through your sketch, checks for errors and compiles it. The upload tool does the same, but when it finishes compiling the code, it also uploads it to the board.\nA good practice is to use the verifying tool before attempting to upload anything. This is a quick way of spotting any errors in your code, so you can fix them before actually uploading the code.\nUploading a Sketch&nbsp;\nUploading a sketch is quick and easy, but let's take a look at what we need to do.\n\n\nOpen the Arduino IDE 2.\n\n\nWith the editor open, let's take a look at the toolbar at the top. At the very left, there is a checkmark and an arrow pointing right. The checkmark is used to verify, and the arrow is used to upload.\n\n\n\nVerifying and uploading buttons\n\nBut before doing any of that, we should choose what board we are uploading to. Beside the verify and upload button you should see a a drop down menu, this will, in most cases, display Arduino boards that are connected to your computer. If your board is not automatically detected, you can either press \"Select other board and port...\" in the drop-down and follow the instructions, or go to Tools &gt; Board and Tools &gt; Port in the toolbar menu to select the board and port manually.\n\n\nSelecting the board.\nSo connect your board to the computer and select it from the drop down menu. You'll know that there is a connection to the board when the board name appears in bold.\n\nSelecting the board.\n\nClick on the verify tool (checkmark). Since we are verifying an empty sketch, we can be sure it is going to compile. After a few seconds, we can see the result of the action in the console (black box in the bottom).\n\n\nSuccessful compilation printed in the console.\n\n\nWith the board selected, we are good to go! Click on the upload button, and it will start uploading the sketch to the board.\n\n\nWhen it is finished, a notification pops up in the bottom right of your IDE window. Of course, sometimes there are some complications when uploading, and these errors will be listed here as well.\n\n\n\nSuccessful upload printed in the console.\nCongratulations, you have now uploaded a sketch to your Arduino board!\nPlease Read (Only Linux Users)&nbsp;\nIt might happen that when you upload a sketch - after you have selected your board and the serial port - you get an error such as \"... Permission denied\". If you get this error, you need to set serial port permission.\nTo do this, open your Terminal and type:\n\nyou will get something like:\n\nThe \"0\" at the end of ACM might be a different number, or multiple entries might be returned. The data we need is \"dialout\" (is the group owner of the file).\nNow we just need to add our user to the group:\n\nwhere &lt;username&gt; is your Linux user name. You will need to log out and log in again for this change to take effect.\n\nAdding user to the group.\nAfter this procedure, you should be able to proceed normally and upload the sketch to your board or use the Serial Monitor.\nResults\nIf you see the Arduino onboard LED blinking (100ms ON, 500ms OFF).

Well, that’s not quite true. No software can generate a truly random number—the closest software can do is to generate a good-enough random number.\nHere is a pseudocode method to get a random number:\n\nThe Math function will return a value from 0 to 1, not including 1. But what if you want an integer from 0 to 100? The calling program will have to convert the return value using a mathematical formula such as this:\n\nEvery time a program needs a random number that does not start with 0, such as a random number from 10 to 20, you will have to write a conversion in the program over and over again. That’s a waste of your valuable time. To generalize the function, let’s do those conversions in a getRandomNumber() method instead.\nThis is a method in pseudocode named getRandomNumber (low, high) that will pass the lowest and the highest value the program wants generated, and then use those values to generate and return a random number between those numbers, inclusive.\nTo solve this: first try just using the low value to restrict the random number, then work on restricting the formula to the high value.\ngetRandomNumnber IPO Input Processing Output) Chart\nInputProcessingOutput\nTwo integers: low and highGenerate a random number between the low and high numbers, inclusive of eachReturn a random number between the input parameters, inclusive\n\nAssume Math.Random() returns a Real number from 0 to 1, not including the number 1. And it will come in handy to remember the concept of integer truncation for this problem! \n\nNOTE: Truncating Real Numbers\nIntegers are round numbers. If you set an integer to a Real number, &gt; the decimal portion of the number is discarded. This comes in handy &gt; in programming so it is something to be aware of.\n\nHere is one solution:\ngetRandomNumber() Method in Pseudocode&nbsp;\n\nLet’s test that code by plugging in some sample numbers.\nWhen we want a random number from 11 to 22, including 11 and 22, here is how the math works out:\n\nNow let’s imagine the Math.random function returns extreme values: 0 and then .999\nFirst let’s plug in 0:\n\nSo, the number 11 is the lowest value that will be returned.\nNow let’s plug in .999:\n\nAnd returning an Integer will strip off the numbers to the right of the decimal, so 22 is the highest value that will be returned.\ngetRandomNumber() Method in Java&nbsp;\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/methods/methods-getrandomnumber/","title":"The getRandomNumber() Method in Pseudocode and Java"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/methods/methods-getstring/":{"body":"The getString() Method&nbsp;\nLast Updated: 2024-04-03\nThe getString() Method in Pseduocode&nbsp;\n\nThe getString() Method In Java used&nbsp;\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/methods/methods-getstring/","title":"The getString() Method"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/methods/methods-getyorn/":{"body":"The getYorN() Method&nbsp;\nLast Updated: 2024-04-03\nThe getYorN() Method In Pseudocode&nbsp;\nThe below method asks the user to enter Y or N using the generalized getString() method\n\nNotice that getYesOrNo() uses getString().

An employee, a hero, a house, a television remote - just about anything you can picture in the real world can be simulated as a software object. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is another way of looking at software.\nOOP Terminology&nbsp;\nObject-Oriented Programming uses all the same concepts you have already learned, but now there are other terms to remember. You must know all of these to talk about and write object oriented code.\nClass&nbsp;\n\nThe blueprint for an object, not the actual object.\n\nObject&nbsp;\n\nAn object is created from the Class. It contains actual data and methods for the object.\n\nMethod&nbsp;\n\nAnother name for module or function.\n\nGetter&nbsp;\n\nA function. A program calls a getter to get the value of a field.\n\nSetter&nbsp;\n\nA module. A program calls a setter to set a field to a value.\n\nField&nbsp;\n\nA word Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) uses instead of variable.\n\nPrivate Fields&nbsp;\n\nVariables in a class are set to private so other programs can’t update them directly.\n\nPublic Methods&nbsp;\n\nMethods are public so other programs can use public methods to get or set fields in that program.\n\nConstructor&nbsp;\n\nA method named for the class that is automatically run when the object is created. It usually initializes the object’s fields. A class/object can have multiple constructors.\n\nEncapsulation&nbsp;\n\nCombining data and code into one object.\n\nUML&nbsp;\n\nUnified Modeling Language. Like Input, Processing, and Output (IPO) Charts and Hierarchy Charts, UML is used to design object oriented classes and programs.\n\nInheritance&nbsp;\n\nA class can ‘extend’ another class which allows it to use the data fields and methods in the superclass.\n\nSuperclass&nbsp;\n\nThe general class, such as Dog. A subclass extends a superclass.\n\nSubclass&nbsp;\n\nThe specialized class, such as Beagle. Beagle extends Dog. A subclass extends the superclass.\n\nPolymorphism&nbsp;\n\nAn object’s ability to take on many forms.\n\nClasses and Objects&nbsp;\nThe class (file) is the blueprint for creating an actual object. A good analogy is a house’s set of blueprints and the actual house itself. You can look at a blueprint (the class), but you can’t actually walk into it. You have to build the actual house first (the object, also called an instance of the class).\n\nKEY CONCEPT\nClasses and Objects do not run by themselves. They just are. Very Zen.\nObjects need to be created and used in a Driver Program. The Driver Program does all the work of creating objects, validating input data, telling the object to change its data, printing its data, and more.\n\nHere is some code from a driver program that creates a House object:\n\nNow you can do things to myHouse like store and change data. You can move in furniture and walk around in it, metaphorically speaking.\n\nAn array of objects can be created like this:\n\nThis doesn’t create the Person objects - it creates an array of 10 elements to hold Person objects. A program could create the first object in the array like this:\n\nConstructors&nbsp;\nWhen an object is created, a method in the class called its constructor is executed. Look at this line of code:\n\nSee the ( )? That means that is a method, right? That’s the constructor. A constructor that does not have any arguments is called a no-arg constructor. (No arguments, get it?)\nIn the House class, you would find this:\n\nAnd check this out: (creating an object with 2 arguments!)\n\nSee the fields in the “( )”? That means that is a method, right? That’s a constructor. And in the House class and object, you would expect to find a constructor that brings in two values as parameters. And you do, as seen below!\n\nNotice in the class above, the data fields are private. That means other programs cannot update the fields directly, but they can use public methods in the class to update the fields’ values. This is done for security and to follow the OOP principle of encapsulation. The objects created from the class are responsible for the data stored in them. The object has final say about how and when its data can be updated. This is very important for objects that hold money, security clearances, bitcoins, or anything else that should be secure.\nGetters and Setters&nbsp;\nIn OOP, objects keep their data private, which means no other program can directly change the data. Other programs must use public methods called getters and setters to get and set data in the object.\n\nKEY CONCEPT\nA famous saying you must understand: Private fields, Public methods\nIt means just what it says! Fields are private, methods are public!\n\nNotice below that the getter does not need an input parameter, but the setter does. Another program is calling the setter to set a field to something new - so there must be an input parameter.\n\nThe below method is also a setter. Because the incoming variable name is the same as the field name in the class, using “this” tells the computer to use the field name for the object instead of the local variable name in the parameter list.\n\nCommon mistakes with getters and setters:&nbsp;\nIn the below code the local variable numberOfBedrooms is set to itself. This setter needed .this as shown above.\n\nIn the below two routines the programmer didn’t think through what a getter and setter should do. They tried to memorize the form without understanding the function.\n\nIf you understand what getters and setters are supposed to do, you don’t have to memorize so much.\nInheritance&nbsp;\nThe concept of inheritance allows a class to extend an existing class. The ‘top’ class is called the superclass. The class that inherits is the subclass. The subclass can use any data fields or methods in the superclass without having them in the subclass. This enables the programmer to change code in one place, the superclass, and all the subclasses will effectively change also.\nBelow is a classic example of inheritance. Beagle inherits characteristics from Dog which inherits characteristics from Animal. Persian inherits data and methods from the Cat class which inherits data and methods from the Animal class.\n\nInheritance can be determined by saying two classes are in an is-a relationship. A beagle is-a dog. Therefore, the Beagle class extends the Dog class. A Persian is not a Dog so it does not inherit anything from the Dog class. But a Persian is a Cat which is an Animal, so Persian inherits from Animal.\nThe Animal, Dog, Beagle, Poodle, Cat, and Persian classes can all be created as objects. Here is how the classes are extended and how a method in Animal can be used in Dog and Beagle objects:\n\n\nNOTE\nIf the function setName() is not in Beagle, but it is in Dog, the function in Dog will be executed. If the function is not in Dog, but it is in Animal, the function in Animal will be executed.\nNote that Beagle does not contain a name field, but Animal does. So, because Beagle extends Dog which extends Animal, Beagle does have a name field where his name is stored.\n\n\n\nNOTE\nThere are two constructors in all three classes.\n\n\n\nNOTE\nIn a driver program, here is how objects could be created:\n\n\nOverriding a Method&nbsp;\nIf the superclass and the subclass have a method named the same, the subclass overrides the superclass and the computer uses the subclass's method and not the superclass's.\n\n\nIn OOP, when a SalariedEmployee object is created as shown above, both the SalariedEmployee's constructor and the Employee's constructor are executed.\nBut, when a program runs the SalariedEmployee's updateSalary(...) method, the computer only runs the updateSalary(...) method in the SalariedEmployee object. The subclass overrides the superclass's method and effectively replaces it. This allows salaried employees to have a different method from the Employee superclass's method.\nWhen a program runs the setSalary(...) method for a SalariedEmployee, the computer sees the method is not in the SalariedEmployee class, so it looks for it in the Employee class. This allows the subclass to inherit methods in the superclass without having to duplicate the code in the subclass. That’s inheritance!\nOverloading a Method&nbsp;\nA program may have two or more methods named the same when they have different parameter lists. You have already seen this when a class contains a no-arg constructor AND a constructor with the same name that accepts at least one parameter.\nOverloading is possible for methods other than just constructors too. For example, this is allowed:\n\nThe computer will know which method to run because the parameter list is different.\nNote that the parameter list must be different enough for the computer to tell there is a difference. For example, this will not work:\n\nBut the below code will work since the computer can distinguish which function to use by the number of parameters or by the sequence of the incoming variable type(s):\n\nUnified Modeling Language (UML)&nbsp;\nThe Unified Modeling Language is used by analysts and programmers to communicate with each other by using a standard methodology to describe an Object-Oriented group of classes and programs. The top section is the name of the class and therefore the file. The middle section lists the fields. The bottom section lists the methods in the class and the required parameters for each method. A negative sign (-) means private, and a plus sign (+) means public.\nThe Student class extends the Person class - in other words, Student inherits the fields and methods from the Person class.\n\n\nNOTE\n\"-\" means private\n\"+\" means public\n\n\nNOTE\nThe arrow means extends (inheritance).\nStudent extends Person.\n\nAccessing an Object&nbsp;\nHere are two instances of a class being created in a driver program:\nPerson person1 = New Person ( )\nPerson person2 = New Person (\"Janet\")\nThen the driver program can call methods in the object by using the object’s variable name, like this:\nperson1.setName(\"Bob\")\nname = person2.getName()\nA Full OOP Example&nbsp;\nUsing the Person and Student Objects from the prior section, we will need a driver program to create and use the objects.\nHere are the specifications for the PersonDriver Program: (what it should do)\n\nCreate the first Person object using the constructor with all the parameters\nCreate the second Person object using the no-arg constructor\nSet the first and last name of the second Person object using setters\nDisplay the full names of each Person.\nCreate the first Student object using the constructor with all the parameters\nCreate the second Student object using the no-arg constructor\nSet the first and last name of the second Student object using setters.\nDisplay the full names of each Student.\nDisplay the full names of each Student which should show the sID (studentID) also.\n\nCan you imagine the code for each of the above classes and the driver program?\nTry to describe the code for each item to someone out loud.\nCoding Exercise:\nWrite the above classes and the driver program in pseudocode.\nCompare your code to the code below.\n(If you can’t write it in pseudocode, you don’t really understand it.)\nFirst, let’s create the superclass:\n\nNext, let’s create a subclass that will inherit from the Person superclass:\n\nNotice that in setFullName() the super.getFullName() tells the computer to use the superclass’s method. So the Student class uses both its own getFullName() method and the superclass’s. The Student class adds the student ID to the full name.\nNow, let’s create a basic Driver Program that will create 2 person objects and 2 student objects:\n\nThe above code is all well and good if we have only a few objects to create, but it would become unwieldy if we had hundreds or thousands of objects. How can we organize this better?\nWith an Array! (But you knew that.)\n\nPolymorphism. One of my favorite words. Notice above that the displayInfo(...) method takes in a Person as a parameter. But the program is sending to it both Person and Student objects. Because Student extends Person the computer will know what to do with each type of object. That’s polymorphism!\nFor the above example to work, the method getFullName() must exist in the superclass as well as in the subclasses.\nCan You Do This?&nbsp;\nFrom your knowledge of OOP concepts and principles, write the below classes and the driver program.\n\nFly extends Insect.\nSpecifications for the InsectDriver Program:\n\nCreate the first Insect object using the constructor with all the parameters\nCreate the second Insect object using the no-arg constructor\nSet the fields of the second Insect object using setters\nDisplay the fields of each Insect.\nCreate the first Fly object using the constructor with all the parameters\nCreate the second Fly object using the no-arg constructor\nSet the fields of the second Fly object using setters.\nDisplay the fields of each fly.\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/oop/object-oriented-programming/","title":"Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/oop/oop-review-questions/":{"body":"Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Review Questions&nbsp;\nLast Updated: 2024-04-03\nYou should be able to answer these questions, discuss their meaning, and give examples.

It contains actual data and methods for the object.\nMethod: Another name for module or function.\nGetter: A function. A program calls a getter to get the value of a field.\nSetter: A module. A program calls a setter to set a field to a value.\nField: A word Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) uses instead of variable.\nPrivate Fields: Variables in a class are set to private so other programs can’t update them directly.\nPublic Methods: Methods are public so other programs can use public methods to get or set fields in that program.\nConstructor: A method named for the class that is automatically run when the object is created. It usually initializes the object’s fields. A class/object can have multiple constructors.\nEncapsulation: Combining data and code into one object.\nUML: Unified Modeling Language. Like Input, Processing, and Output (IPO) Charts and Hierarchy Charts, UML is used to design object oriented classes and programs.\nInheritance: A class can ‘extend’ another class which allows it to use the data fields and methods in the superclass.\nSuperclass: The general class, such as Dog. A subclass extends a superclass.\nSubclass: The specialized class, such as Beagle. Beagle extends Dog. A subclass extends the superclass.\nPolymorphism: An object’s ability to take on many forms.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/oop/oop-terminology/","title":"Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Terminology"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/oop/oop/":{"body":"Table Of Contents - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)&nbsp;\nLast Updated: 2024-04-03\n\n\nObject-Oriented Programming (OOP) Terminology\n\n\nObject-Oriented Programming\n\n\nObject-Oriented Programming (OOP) Review Questions\n\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/oop/oop/","title":"Table of Contents - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/resources/":{"body":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/resources/","title":"Resources"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/resources/diataxis-a-systematic-approach-to-technical-documentation-authoring/":{"body":"Diátaxis: A systematic approach to technical documentation authoring.&nbsp;\nLast Updated: 2024-04-03\nDiátaxis is a way of thinking about and doing documentation.\nIt prescribes approaches to content, architecture and form that emerge from a systematic approach to understanding the needs of documentation users.\nDiátaxis identifies four distinct needs, and four corresponding forms of documentation - tutorials, how-to guides, technical reference and explanation.
