The shaft or spindle of a stepper motor rotates in discrete step increments when electrical command pulses are applied to it in the proper sequence. The motors rotation has several direct relationships to these applied input pulses. The sequence of the applied pulses is directly related to the direction of motor shafts rotation. The speed of the motor shafts rotation is directly related to the frequency of the input pulses and the length of rotation is directly related to the number of input pulses applied.

If you\u2019ve got the leads of your meter connected to two wires that are not connected (i.e. not attached to the same coil), you should see infinite resistance (or no continuity).</p>","boost":1},{"location":"arduino/labs/lab-5-collision-avoidance/#mb-v2-breadboard-power-supply-module","title":"MB-V2 Breadboard Power Supply Module","text":"<p>The small DC motor is likely to use more power than an UNO R3 board digital output can handle directly.

Notice how, for each of these, you could say the child class \"is-a\" parent class.</p> <pre><code>flowchart BT\n    Airplane --&gt; Vehicle\n    GasGiant --&gt; Planet\n    Platypus --&gt; Mammal</code></pre> <p>We could instantiate an instance of each child class as follows:</p> <pre><code>Airplane flight = new Airplane(\"Boeing\", 747, \"VH-OJL\");\nGasGiant destination = new GasGiant(\"Saturn\");\nPlatypus secrentAgent = new Platypus(\"Perry\");\n</code></pre> <p>Note that the child class is not a proper noun, but the instantiation includes a proper noun. Also, in each case, the variable name refers to how the object will be used in the program.</p> <p>The derived class can do any or all of the following: - Add new variables - Add new methods - Change existing methods by overriding - Have a new name and otherwise be identical to the parent class</p> <p>Java uses the extends keyword to indicate one class is inheriting from another. Java permits a class to inherit from only one other class. Recall that the super reference refers to the parent class. The most common use is to call the parent's constructor from the child class - <code>super()</code>. Java requires the call to the parent\u2019s constructor (if there is one) to be the first line of the constructor.</p> <p>In the code below, we define a class that inherits from the GameCharacter class we saw above. The Wizard class extends GameCharacter, so it has name, health, and strength members that it inherits. It also adds an array of spells.</p> <p><pre><code>public class Wizard extends GameCharacter {\n\n    private Spell spells[];\n\n    // methods go here\n}\n</code></pre> Notice that the Wizard class is associated to GameCharacter through inheritance (a Wizard \"is-a\" GameCharacter) and to Spell through containment (a Wizard \"has-a\" array of spells)</p> <p>Inheritance provides many benefits. It eliminates the need to re-implement the same methods multiple times. Any changes to a parent class are instantly propagated to the child classes. Abstract classes (which we will cover next) can serve as a blueprint for child classes to reduce development time.</p>","boost":1},{"location":"csc205/module-2/inheritance-and-exceptions-notes/#inheritance-vs-containment","title":"Inheritance vs. Containment","text":"<p>Use inheritance when there is an \"is-a\" relationship between the two classes and you want to reuse a lot of the parent class\u2019s members. Use containment when there is a \"has-a\" relationship. Think of a <code>Car</code> class which could inherit from <code>Vehicle</code> and use its <code>start</code>, <code>steer</code>, and <code>brake</code> methods. It could also contain <code>Tire</code> (hopefully 4!), <code>Engine</code>, and <code>SteeringWheel</code> classes, among others.</p> Object Relationship Object Computer has-a CPU Rocket has-a Engine Song has-a Title Old MacDonald has-a Farm House has-a Den Square is-a Shape Kitchen is-a Room MacBook is-a Computer Zilog Z8000 is-a CPU Grasshopper is-a Insect <p>Suppose we want to create a <code>Sedan</code> class. A sedan \"is-a\" car, so it would extend a <code>Car</code> class. A sedan has 4 doors and a trunk, so it would contain those as members (in addition to elements like 4 wheels, a transmission, and other members it would get from <code>Car</code>). So the (partial) class definition would look something like this:</p> <pre><code>public class Sedan extends Car // Sedan \"is-a\" car {\n\n    private int trunk;       // Sedan \"has-a\" trunk\n    private Door doors[4];   // Sedan \"has-a\" set of 4 doors\n}\n</code></pre> <p>To summarize, the Sedan class would inherit from Car since a sedan is-a car, and it would contain 4 doors and a trunk since a sedan has-a trunk and has-a set of 4 doors.</p> <p>Note that there are exceptions to the is-a and has-a rules. Even if there is not a clear is-a relationship you may want to use inheritance if the child class needs most of the parent class's methods. You may want to use containment even if there is not a has-a relationship if you want to change access to a parent class's members. For example, suppose you have a <code>Backpack</code> class with a <code>public open()</code> method - maybe you want to use containment so that you can create your own <code>private open()</code> method that calls the <code>Backpack.open()</code> method.</p>","boost":1},{"location":"csc205/module-2/inheritance-and-exceptions-notes/#special-references-this-and-super","title":"Special References - <code>this</code> and <code>super</code>","text":"<p>Java objects contain two special references. The \"this\" reference refers to the object itself. It allows an object to refer to itself, such as calling another overloaded constructor or referring to its members when they have been shadowed by a local variable name or parameter. This reference can be useful to make methods more clear, especially when another object of the same type is involved, such as when a class has a method that takes an object of that same class as a parameter (as with <code>compareTo</code>).</p> <p>The \"super\" reference refers to the parent class of an object. The super reference can be used to call the parent class's constructor (always a good idea!). For example, in the example below, from the last module's notes, we call the <code>Account</code> class parent constructor:</p> <pre><code>public Account(String name, int credits) {\n        super();\n        this.name = name;\n        this.level = credits;\n        this.accountNumber = generateAccountNumber();\n}\n</code></pre> <p>The super constructor must be called in the first line of code in the constructor or else not at all.</p> <p>It can also be used if both the parent class and the child class have a member with the same name (which is not good class design). </p> <p>Note that neither this nor super can be used in a static method since they refer to a specific instance. </p> <p>The diagram below demonstrates how these special references work. The <code>super</code> reference can be used to access (public or protected) members of the parent class. The <code>this</code> reference can be used to access all members of the child class except for private members and shadowed members of the parent class. If we have shadowed members, for example if both the parent and child classes declare a variable called <code>MyNumber</code>, then there are two copies of the <code>MyNumber</code> in every object of the child class - one from the parent class and one from the child class. You can see how this can only reference the <code>MyNumber</code> from the child class, but we can use super to refer to the <code>MyNumber</code> from the parent class. </p> \"this\" Members \"super\"  Yes Parent Class Members  Yes  Yes Shadowed Members  Yes  Yes Child Class Members   No <p>However, to reiterate - shadowed members are a bad thing and should be avoided unless absolutely necessary.

Eclipse adds the <code>@Override</code> annotation when you have it automatically generate inherited abstract methods. The annotation has no impact on how the program runs. However, it does help the programmer avoid bugs by indicating when a method that is intended to override another method is not actually overriding anything. For example, if we added a parameter to the toString method above we would get a compiler error.</p> <p></p> <p>This can prevent hard-to-find bugs where the wrong method is being called. </p> <p>To reiterate, you can override a method with or without using the <code>@Override</code> annotation.

Subsystems may then be assigned to different developers or groups of developers who will develop the subsystem to meet its specification.</p> <p>An object is the perfect mechanism for creating a collection, because if it is designed correctly, the internal workings of an object are encapsulated from the rest of the system. In most cases, the instance variables defined in a class should be declared with private visibility. Therefore, only the methods of that class can access and modify them. The only interaction a user has with an object should be through its public methods, which represent the services that the object provides.</p> <p>As we progress through our exploration of collections, we will always stress the idea of separating the interface from the implementation.

Even though copy, paste, and modify is technically a form of reuse, this brute force type of reuse is not our goal. Reuse, in its purest form, should mean that we create a collection that is written once, is compiled into byte code once, and will then handle any objects we choose to store in it safely, efficiently, and effectively. To accomplish these goals, we must take type compatibility and type checking into account. Type compatibility indicates whether a particular assignment of an object to a reference is legal. For example, the following assignment is not legal because you cannot assign a reference declared to be of type String to point to an object of type Integer.</p> <pre><code>String x = new Integer(10);\n</code></pre> <p>Java provides compile-time type checking that will flag this invalid assignment.

Inheritance can be used to create a class hierarchy<sup>15</sup> where a reference variable can be used to point to any object related to it by inheritance.</p> <p>Carrying this to the extreme, an Object reference can be used to refer to any object, because ultimately all classes are descendants of the Object class. An ArrayList that is instantiated without specifying a type, for example, uses polymorphism in that it is designed to hold Object references. That's why an ArrayList can be used to store any kind of object. A particular ArrayList can hold several different types of objects at one time, because they are all objects compatible with type Object.</p> <p>The result of this discussion would seem to be that we could simply store Object references in our stack and take advantage of polymorphism via inheritance to create a collection that can store any type of objects. However, this possible solution creates some unexpected consequences. Because in this chapter we focus on implementing a stack with an array, let's examine what can happen when dealing with polymorphic references and arrays.

That is, we can define a class so that it stores, operates on, and manages objects whose type is not specified until the class is instantiated. Generics are an integral part of our discussions of collections and their underlying implementations throughout the rest of this text.</p> <p>Let's assume we need to define a class called <code>Box</code> that stores and manages other objects. As we discussed, using polymorphism, we could simply define <code>Box</code> so that internally it stores references to the <code>Object</code> class. Then, any type of object could be stored inside a box. In fact, multiple types of unrelated objects could be stored in <code>Box</code>. We lose a lot of control with that level of flexibility in our code.</p> <p>A better approach is to define the <code>Box</code> class to store a generic type <code>T</code>. (We can use any identifier we want for the generic type, but using <code>T</code> has become a convention.) The header of the class contains a reference to the type in angle brackets. For example:</p> <pre><code>class Box&lt;T&gt;\n{\n   // declarations and code that manage objects of type T \n}\n</code></pre> <p>Then, when a <code>Box</code> is needed, it is instantiated with a specific class used in place of <code>T</code>. For example, if we wanted a <code>Box</code> of <code>Widget</code> objects, we could use the following declaration:</p> <pre><code>Box&lt;Widget&gt; box1 = new Box&lt;Widget&gt;();\n</code></pre> <p>The type of the <code>box1</code> variable is <code>Box&lt;Widget&gt;</code>. In essence, for the <code>box1</code> object, the <code>Box</code> class replaces <code>T</code> with <code>Widget</code>. Now suppose we wanted a <code>Box</code> in which to store <code>Gadget</code> objects; we could make the following declaration:</p> <pre><code>Box&lt;Gadget&gt; box2 = new Box&lt;Gadget&gt;();\n</code></pre> <p>For <code>box2</code>, the <code>Box</code> class essentially replaces <code>T</code> with <code>Gadget</code>. So, although the <code>box1</code> and <code>box2</code> objects are both boxes, they have different types because the generic type is taken into account. This is a safer implementation, because at this point we cannot use <code>box1</code> to store gadgets (or anything else for that matter other than widgets), nor could we use <code>box2</code> to store widgets. A generic type such as <code>T</code> cannot be instantiated. It is merely a placeholder to allow us to define the class that will manage a specific type of object that is established when the class is instantiated.</p> <p>Using generic types in this way is only possible because Java allows late or dynamic binding. This means that the type of the object, or in our case the type of the element in the collection, is determined at run-time and not at compile-time. For example, if we want to create an <code>ArrayList</code> bound to a specific type other than <code>Object</code>, we can specify the type at the time we instantiate the <code>ArrayList</code>. For example, the following code would instantiate an <code>ArrayList</code> to hold gadgets:</p> <pre><code>ArrayList&lt;Gadget&gt; = new ArrayList&lt;Gadget&gt;;\n</code></pre> <p>Given that we now have a mechanism using generic types for creating a collection that can be used to store any type of object safely and effectively, let's continue on with our discussion of the stack collection.</p> <p>The following section explores in detail an example of using a stack to solve a problem.</p>","boost":1},{"location":"csc205/notes/javafoundations/chapter12/#124-using-stacks-evaluating-postfix-expressions","title":"12.4 Using Stacks: Evaluating Postfix Expressions","text":"<p>Traditionally, arithmetic expressions are written in infix notation, meaning that the operator is placed between its operands in the form</p> <p><code>&lt;operand&gt; &lt;operator&gt; &lt;operand&gt;</code></p> <p>such as in the expression</p> <p><code>4 + 5</code></p> <p>When evaluating an infix expression<sup>19</sup>, we rely on precedence rules to determine the order of operator evaluation. For example, the expression</p> <p><code>4 + 5 * 2</code></p> <p>evaluates to 14 rather than 18 because of the precedence rule that in the absence of parentheses, multiplication evaluates before addition.</p> <p>In a postfix expression, the operator comes after its two operands. Therefore, a postfix expression<sup>20</sup> takes the form</p> <p><code>&lt;operand&gt; &lt;operator&gt; &lt;operand&gt;</code></p> <p>For example, the postfix expression</p> <p><code>6 9 -</code></p> <p>is equivalent to the infix expression</p> <p><code>6 - 9</code></p> <p>A postfix expression is generally easier to evaluate than an infix expression because precedence rules and parentheses are not needed to guarantee evaluation order. The order of the values and operators in the expression is sufficient to determine the result. For this reason, programming language compilers and run-time environments often use postfix expressions in their internal calculations.</p> <p>The process of evaluating a postfix expression can be stated in one simple rule: Scanning from left to right, apply each operation to the two operands immediately preceding it and replace the operator with the result. At the end we are left with the final value of the expression.</p> <p>Consider the infix expression we looked at earlier:</p> <p><code>4 + 5 * 2</code></p> <p>In postfix notation, this expression would be written</p> <p><code>4 5 2 * +</code></p> <p>Let's use our evaluation rule to determine the final value of this expression. We scan from the left until we encounter the multiplication (<code>*</code>) operator. We apply this operator to the two operands immediately preceding it (<code>5</code> and <code>2</code>) and replace it with the result (<code>10</code>), which leaves us with</p> <p><code>4 10 +</code></p> <p>Continuing our scan from left to right, we immediately encounter the plus (<code>+</code>) operator. Applying this operator to the two operands immediately preceding it (<code>4</code> and <code>10</code>) yields <code>14</code>, which is the final value of the expression.</p> <p>Let's look at a slightly more complicated example. Consider the following infix expression:</p> <p><code>(3 * 4 - (2 + 5)) * 4 / 2</code></p> <p>The equivalent postfix expression is</p> <p><code>3 4 * 2 5 + - 4 * 2 /</code></p> <p>Applying our evaluation rule results in</p> <p><pre><code>         12 2 5 + - 4 * 2 /\nthen     12 7 - 4 * 2 /\nthen     5 4 * 2 /\nthen     20 2 /\nthen     10\n</code></pre> Now let's consider the design of a program that will evaluate a postfix expression. The evaluation rule relies on being able to retrieve the previous two operands whenever we encounter an operator.

If it is an operand, push it onto the stack. If it is an operator, pop the top two elements off the stack, apply the operation to them, and push the result onto the stack. When we reach the end of the expression, the element remaining on the stack is the result of the expression. If at any point we attempt to pop two elements off the stack but there are not two elements on the stack, then our postfix expression was not properly formed. Similarly, if we reach the end of the expression and more than one element remains on the stack, then our expression was not well formed.

When executed, the program repeatedly accepts and evaluates postfix expressions until the user chooses to stop.</p> <p>The <code>PostfixEvaluator</code> class uses the <code>java.util.Stack</code> class to create the stack attribute. The <code>java.util.Stack</code> class is one of two stack implementations provided by the Java Collections API. We revisit the other implementation, the <code>Deque</code> interface, in Chapter 13.</p> <p>The <code>evaluate</code> method performs the evaluation algorithm described earlier, supported by the <code>isOperator</code> and <code>evalSingleOp</code> methods. Note that in the <code>evaluate</code> method, only operands are pushed onto the stack. Operators are used as they are encountered and are never put on the stack. This is consistent with the evaluation algorithm we discussed. An operand is put on the stack as an <code>Integer</code> object, instead of as an <code>int</code> primitive value, because the stack collection is designed to store objects.</p> <p>When an operator is encountered, the two most recent operands are popped off the stack. As mentioned above, the first operand popped is actually the second operand in the expression and that the second operand popped is the first operand in the expression. This order doesn't matter in the cases of addition and multiplication, but it certainly matters for subtraction and division.</p> <p>Note also that the postfix expression program assumes that the postfix expression entered is valid, meaning that it contains a properly organized set of operators and operands. A postfix expression is invalid if either (1) two operands are not available on the stack when an operator is encountered or (2) there is more than one value on the stack when the tokens in the expression are exhausted. Either situation indicates that there was something wrong with the format of the expression, and both can be caught by examining the state of the stack at the appropriate point in the program. We will discuss how we might deal with these situations and other exceptional cases in the next section.</p> <p>Perhaps the most important aspect of this program is the use of the class that defined the stack collection. At this point, we don't know how the stack was implemented. We simply trusted the class to do its job. In this example, we used the class <code>java.util.Stack</code>, but we could have used any class that implemented a stack as long as it performed the stack operations as expected. From the point of view of evaluating postfix expressions, the manner in which the stack is implemented is largely irrelevant. Figure 12.7 shows a UML class diagram for the postfix expression evaluation program. The diagram illustrates that the <code>PostfixEvaluator</code> class uses an <code>Integer</code> instance of the <code>java.util.Stack</code> class and represents the binding of the <code>Integer</code> to the generic type <code>T</code>.

What action should the collection take in the exceptional case? There are some such cases that are inherent in the collection itself. For example, in the case of a stack, what should happen if an attempt is made to pop an element from an empty stack? In this case, it does not matter what data structure is being used to implement the collection; the exception will still apply. Some such cases are artifacts of the data structure being used to implement the collection. For example, if we are using an array to implement a stack, what should happen if an attempt is made to push an element onto the stack but the array is full? Let's take a moment to explore this concept further.</p> <p>As discussed in Chapter 10, problems that arise in a Java program may generate exceptions or errors. An exception<sup>24</sup> is an object that defines an unusual or erroneous situation. An exception is thrown by a program or the run-time environment, and it can be caught and handled appropriately if desired. An error is similar to an exception, except that an error generally represents an unrecoverable situation, and it should not be caught. Java has a predefined set of exceptions and errors that may occur during the execution of a program. However, we often find it useful to develop our own specific exceptions.</p> <p>In our postfix evaluation example, there were several potential exceptional situations. For example:</p> <ul> <li> <p>If the stack were full on a push</p> </li> <li> <p>If the stack were empty on a pop</p> </li> <li> <p>If the stack held more than one value at the completion of the evaluation</p> </li> </ul> <p>Let's consider each of these separately. The possibility that the stack might be full on a push is an issue for the underlying data structure, not the collection. Conceptually speaking, there is no such thing as a full stack. Now we know that this is not reality and that all data structures will eventually reach a limit. However, even when this physical limit is reached, the stack is not full; only the data structure that implements the stack is full. We will discuss strategies for handling this situation as we implement our stack in the next section.</p> <p>What if the stack is empty on a pop? This is an exceptional case that has to do with the problem, not the underlying data structure. In our postfix evaluation example, if we attempt to pop two operands and there are not two operands available on the stack, our postfix expression was not properly formed. This is a case where the collection needs to report the exception and the application then must interpret that exception in context.</p> <p>The third case is equally interesting. What if the stack holds more than one value at the completion of the evaluation? From the perspective of the stack collection, this is not an exception. However, from the perspective of the application, this is a problem that means once again that the postfix expression was not well formed. Because it will not generate an exception from the collection, this is a condition for which the application must test.</p> <p>Key Concept</p> <p>Errors and exceptions represent unusual or invalid processing.</p> <p>Chapter 10 includes a complete discussion of exceptions and exception handling, including exception propagation and the try/catch statement.

There are various ways to implement a class\u00a0that represents a stack. As mentioned earlier, the Java Collections API provides multiple implementations including the Stack class and the Deque interface.

For example, the following instantiation creates an array that can store 500 <code>Object</code> references, indexed from 0 to 499:</p> <pre><code>Object[] collection = Object[500];\n</code></pre> <p>Note that this instantiation allocates space for the <code>Object</code> references but does not allocate space for the objects themselves. Thus, creating an array of objects requires both instantiating the array and instantiating the objects to be stored in the array.</p> <p>The number of cells in an array is called its <code>capacity</code>. This value is stored in the <code>length</code> constant of the array. The capacity of an array cannot be changed once the array has been created.</p> <p>When using an array to implement a collection, we have to deal with the situation in which all cells of the array are being used to store elements. That is, because we are using a fixed-size data structure, at some point the data structure may become \"full.\" However, just because the data structure is full, should that mean that the collection is full?</p> <p>A crucial question in the design of a collection is what to do in the case in which a new element is added to a full data structure. Three basic options exist:</p> <ul> <li> <p>We could implement operations that add an element to the collection such that they throw an exception if the data structure is full.</p> </li> <li> <p>We could implement the add operations to return a status indicator that can be checked by the user to see whether the add operation was successful.</p> </li> <li> <p>We could automatically expand the capacity of the underlying data structure whenever necessary so that, essentially, it would never become full.</p> </li> </ul> <p>In the first two cases, the user of the collection must be aware that the collection could get full and must take steps to deal with it when needed.

Furthermore, the capacity issue is particular to this implementation. Other techniques used to implement the collection, such as the one we explore in the next chapter, are not restricted by a fixed capacity and therefore never have to deal with this issue.</p> <p>In the solutions presented in this text, we opt to implement fixed size data structure solutions by automatically expanding the capacity of the underlying data structure.

The ANSI standard was issued in 1988. </p> <p>Updated standards were developed in 1999 &amp; 2011, though the ANSI standard is still the most commonly used. During the late 1980\u2019s through the mid 1990\u2019s, C was one of the most popular languages for end-user applications, though languages such as C++, Java, and C# are more widely used for end-user applications today. However, C is still widely used, especially in embedded systems and other places where efficiency (both speed and memory) is the primary consideration. If efficiency is not a necessary goal of your application then another, safer, language such as Java, C#, etc. may be better suited. C++, especially modern standards, provides a nice balance between the efficiency of C and the safety of other languages. </p> <p>C was designed to be a language for solving specific problems.

While code that invokes undefined behavior may do what you expect, your program would still not be correct because another compiler may choose to do something else. When you are writing important applications it is important to understand what syntax can invoke undefined behavior and how your specific compiler handles it.</p>","boost":1},{"location":"csc240/c/c1-notes/#c-basics-chapters-1-5","title":"C Basics (Chapters 1-5)","text":"<p>If you are coming from a background in Java, some of the C syntax may look familiar to you. Many more recent languages based their syntax on C, though the underlying semantics are usually very different.</p> <p>The following code is a simple example of a C program.</p> <pre><code>/* C Hello World example */\n#include&lt;stdio.h&gt;\n\nint main(void) {\n  printf(\"Hello, world!\\n\");\n  return 0;\n}\n</code></pre> <p>The first line is a comment, which must start with <code>/*</code> and end with <code>*/</code>. Comments can span multiple lines. The \"<code>#include</code>\" statement tells the compiler you are using functions defined in <code>stdio.h</code> (we will talk more about that later - for now you should know that these \".h\" files are called header files and you include .h files in your .c files. You do not include .c files). Then the main function is the entry point for our program - it is what will be called when the program is executed. Output to the console is generated by the printf statement. The '<code>\\n</code>' is a newline character. The return statement indicates to the operating system that the program terminated successfully (<code>0</code> is the convention for a successful exit).</p> <p>To compile a C program, use the following command:</p> <pre><code>gcc --std=c11 -pedantic -Wall filename.c\n</code></pre> <p>The name of the compiler we will be using is gcc. The <code>-pedantic</code> flag tells gcc that you want it to be strict about standard C code and warn you when you do something that is not strictly standard C. The <code>-Wall</code> flag tells gcc that you want it to warn you about everything it finds that could be problematic. You should always strive to write code that produces no warnings. Warnings almost always indicate a subtle bug. </p> <p>In C, variables (and functions) must be declared before you use them. C also allows global variables to be declared that are not part of any function. Global variables are available throughout the execution of the program. As such, they cause difficult bugs and should be avoided in most cases. </p> <p>The following program declares two variables, one of type int and one of type double.</p> <pre><code>#include&lt;stdio.h&gt;\n\nint main(void) {\n  int num1 = 10;\n  double num2 = 3.14;\n  printf(\"num1=%d, num2=%.1f\\n\", num1, num2);\n  return 0;\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Note that the <code>printf</code> statement is different from the first one we saw. The <code>printf</code> function lets you specify control sequences that will be replaced by the expressions that follow. In the above example, the <code>%d</code> is replaced by the value of <code>num1</code> and the<code>%.1f</code> is replaced by the value of <code>num2</code>. The '<code>.1</code>' indicates that you want to display one decimal place. The expressions that follow the string do not have to be variables - they can be any valid expression, including a function call - though the types need to match. </p> <p>Data is represented by states: collections of variables and their values. Variables have several different attributes:</p> <ul> <li>Name: A name associated with a memory location </li> <li>Value: What is stored in memory </li> <li>Type: Permitted values and operations </li> <li>Location: Where the data is stored in memory </li> <li>Address: Permanent label for the location of stored data </li> <li>Reference/pointer: A variable that holds an address </li> <li>Scope (visibility): the part of the code in which we can use the variable\u2019s name</li> </ul> <p>At the machine level, the value stored in any memory location is just a sequence of bits. A variable declaration binds a name to a location in memory and describes the attributes of the value in the location. The scope of a declaration starts from the declaration and extends to the end of the current block. Variables and functions must be declared before they are used. </p> <p>C provides the following data types (along with their control sequences):</p> <ul> <li>Integer (<code>int</code>)</li> <li><code>123</code> - integer constant - <code>%d</code> or <code>%i</code></li> <li><code>0123</code> - octal constant - <code>%o</code></li> <li><code>0x123ABC</code> - hexadecimal constant - <code>%x</code></li> <li>Floating-point (<code>float</code>)</li> <li><code>3.14f</code> - <code>%f</code> (or <code>%e</code> for scientific notation, <code>%g</code> to let C decide)</li> <li>Double-precision floating-point (<code>double</code>)</li> <li><code>3.14</code> - <code>%f</code> (or <code>%e</code> for scientific notation, <code>%g</code> to let C decide)</li> <li>Character (<code>char</code>)</li> <li>'<code>a</code>' - <code>%c</code></li> <li>'<code>\\n</code>'</li> <li>Boolean (<code>_Bool</code>)</li> <li><code>0</code> - false </li> <li><code>1</code> - true</li> <li><code>stdbool.h</code> defines the type \"<code>bool</code>\" and constants false and true.</li> </ul> <p>The C standard specifies minimum sizes for each data type, but not maximums. </p> <p>Note that when using control sequences that C will treat the expression as the type specified by the control sequence. </p> <p>C has both signed &amp; unsigned types. Signed types allow negative values, whereas unsigned types are always positive. For an unsigned int, all the bits are used to represent the number, but for an int the \ufb01rst bit is often used to store the sign. You should be careful when using signed &amp; unsigned types in the same expression. For example, given the de\ufb01nitions below</p> <pre><code>int a = -1;\nunsigned int b = 1;\n</code></pre> <p>Is <code>a &lt; b</code> or <code>a &gt; b</code>?  All values are stored in memory as a sequence of bits. When you treat a negative signed value as an unsigned value, the sign bit represents the largest value instead of the sign so your number will be very large. So, <code>a &lt; b</code> will evaluate to false if the comparison uses unsigned values since the sign bit of variable a will be <code>1</code> (it is negative) which makes it a very large unsigned value. Here is a program you can run to test this yourself:</p> <p>``` c</p>","boost":1},{"location":"csc240/c/c1-notes/#include","title":"include <p>int main(void) {   int a = -1;   unsigned int b = 1;</p> <p>printf(\"int a = %d, unsigned int b = %u\\n\", a, b);   if (a &lt;b)     printf(\"a is less than b\\n\");   else     printf(\"b is less than a\\n\");   return 0; } ```</p> <p>Some of the types above can be modified with one of the following specifiers: * long - 1234L (%li, %ld, %lo, %lx) for integers or for 1.23L( %Lf, %Le, %Lg) for floating-point * long long - 1234LL (%lli) * short - (%hd) * unsigned - 0xffffU (%u) - the U/%u can be combined with the length descriptors above * signed  There are several qualifiers that can be used in variable declarations in addition to the type modifiers above: * const - indicates that the value of the variable should not be changed. Keep in mind that while the value cannot be changed using the variable name, with some effort, the value could be changed through a pointer. * static - indicates that the value of the variable should be maintained. When used in a function the value is \u201cremembered\u201d from the previous call to the function. They are initialized only the first time the function is called. In subsequent calls to the function they keep their last value.</p> <p>Column width can be specified in a control sequence by inserting a column width. Decimal precision can be specified using X in the control sequence. printf(\u201c%3d %10d %10.2f\\n\u201d, x, y, z);</p> <p>The scanf function will read a value from the user into a variable. For example, the statement scanf (\"%d\", &amp;b); will read an integer into the variable b from user input. Note the &amp; character - that is required. Leaving it out can cause your program to crash. We will discuss the meaning of the &amp; later.</p> <p>Constants in C C has three ways to define constant values: * Constant variables declared with const * Macros (#define) where the value is substituted by the compiler * Enumerated types (enum) which are user-defined types with explicitly named integer values You cannot change the value of macro or enumerated type constants and neither one has memory allocated to it. Constant variables have memory allocated to them, so while you cannot modify them directly it is possible for their value to be changed through indirection (pointers).  We will discuss macros and enumerated types in more detail later in the notes.</p> <p>Associativity &amp; Precedence Precedence and associativity affect the grouping and evaluation of operands in expressions. Precedence determines which operators are evaluated \ufb01rst. Associativity determines the direction in which operators with the same precedence are evaluated (left-to-right or right-to-left). Most C references have precedence &amp; associativity charts listed in them. It is best practice to use parentheses to remove any confusion that might arise due to associativity &amp; precedence.  Associativity Examples:  The left-associative operators + and - have the same precedence, so the following expressions are all equivalent:  x + 3 - y + 5  (x + 3) - y + 5  ((x + 3) - y) + 5  ((x + 3) - y + 5)  The right-associative operators =, += and -= have the same precedence, so the following expressions are all equivalent: x = y += z -= 4  x = y += (z -= 4)  x = (y += (z -= 4))  (x = y += (z -= 4))</p> <p>C &amp; C++ use lazy evaluation \u2013 expressions are only evaluated when (and if) their value is needed. So, suppose you have an if statement with a compound boolean expression as follows: if (expression1 &amp;&amp; expression2)  Then if expression1 evaluates to false then expression2 will not be evaluated because its value does not affect the result of the entire compound boolean expression. C only evaluates an expression if it has to - once it evaluates enough to know what the result is it stops.</p> <p>For example, suppose you have an if statement with two function calls like the following (keep in mind that we evaluate an expression with a function call by calling the function and examining its return value): if (willing() &amp;&amp; able()) Here, the function has to be called in order to know if it evaluates to true or false. However, if willing() returns false, then the if statement cannot evaluate to true, regardless of the result of able(). We only need to call able() if calling willing() returns true.  Or, suppose we have an or condition instead of an and - then if willing() returns true, then the if statement cannot evaluate to false, regardless of the result of able(). We only need to call able() if calling willing() returns false.  if (willing() &amp;&amp; able())</p> <p>You need to be careful not to assume that every expression in a boolean expression will be evaluated. For example, in the code below y will not be incremented if x &lt; y. if ((x &lt; y) || (++y &gt; 10))  This code is not particularly well written - the following (equivalent code) is much more clear in its intent: if (x &lt; y) {     ++y;     if (y &gt; 10) {         /* do some stuff     } } Yes, this is more code, but what is actually happening is more clear - and clarity is always better.        </p> <p>Control structures C provides several different control structures for controlling program flow. These include the following: * for loop * while loop * do .. while loop * if .. else  * switch statements * The conditional statement (? .. : ..) Any of the above structures can be nested inside each other. The C statements \u201cbreak\u201d and \u201ccontinue\u201c allow the program flow to be interrupted. The file control.c in the example code has examples of each of the above. While C allows the programmer to write very complex expressions inside of these control structures, simple and clear code is always easier to debug and maintain.</p> <p>L-values &amp; r-values An object in C that has a memory location associated with it is called an l-value. This would include objects such as variables and arrays. (Note that we are using the term \u201cobject\u201d here in the general sense, not in the object-oriented sense). Objects that do not have memory locations associated with them are called r-values. R-values do not have any memory associated with them. </p> <p>You will sometimes see l-value &amp; r-value defined in terms of where they can appear in an assignment - an l-value can usually appear on the left-hand side of an assignment (meaning that you can assign a value to it) and an r-value can only appear on the right hand side. For example: lvalue = rvalue;    / OK / rvalue = lvalue;    / Not OK / But keep in mind that since an l-value has memory associated with it, it can be evaluated to a value so it can appear on either side of the assignment operator (the left side or the right side): lvalue = another_lvalue;    / Also OK / Also, some types of l-values cannot appear on the left hand side of an assignment, such as constant variables and arrays. Most literals (int literals such as 123 or char literals such as \u2018A\u2019) are r-values, but string literals are actually l-values since they are stored in memory.  Arrays (Chapter 6) Arrays C arrays are homogeneous collections of data elements of the same type. Individual elements in an array are accessed by their index. So an array declared as int[4] has 4 elements: int[0], int[1], int[2], and int[3]. C does not do bounds checking, so you can access, for example, int[8]. In that case, the program will compile and will likely run, but the results will be unpredictable. Modern C allows the size of the array to be a variable.</p> <p>Arrays can be initialized when they are declared, but that is not required.  int a1[4]; int a2[4] = {1,2,3,4}; int a3[] = {1,2,3,4,5}; int a4[2][3] = {{1,2,3},{4,5,6}}; In the examples above, a1 is an array of 4 integers that is not initialized. The next array, a2, is an array of 4 integers that is initialized. If the initializer has more elements than the array the extra elements will be ignored. The third array, a3, is an array of 5 integers initialized with a list of 5 integers. Note that the size of a3 is implicitly defined based on the length of the initializer list. The final array, a4, is a 2-dimensional array. Note that it is initialized with an array of arrays. 2-dimensional arrays are references with 2 indices, as in a4[0][2]. Arrays can only be initialized in the above manner when they are declared. Functions (Chapter 7) C programs are made up of functions (also called procedures or subroutines) - named blocks of code that are explicitly called by the program. The purpose of functions are * Abstraction - statements form a conceptual unit * Reuse - statements are executed in multiple locations In addition to the built-in functions, the programmer can define their own functions. Just like with variables, functions must be declared before they are used.  Functions communicate with the rest of the program through global variables, parameters, or return values.  A C function is declared with:         return_type function_name(parameters) If the function is not being defined when it is declared, the declaration should end with a semicolon (called a forward declaration). The forward declaration ensures that the function is in scope even though it hasn\u2019t been defined yet so we can use it before it is defined. The argument names are optional in a forward declaration, but the types are required. If we use a function before it is declared, C assumes the function returns an int.  void bar(int);         / forward declaration /  int foo(int, float);   / forward declaration /  . . .  int foo(int x, float f) {   ...   bar(x);  / call function bar() / } void bar(int y) {  / declaration of function bar() /  . . .  }  It is good practice to break up your program into multiple, well-named functions. Well-chosen function names make code much more readable. Functions with a return type of void do not need a return statement - control will return to the caller at the end of the function. </p> <p>The parameters in the declaration are called formal parameters and are local variables of the function. When the function is called, actual parameters are used. Suppose I have the code below int do_something(int a, int b) {   / do some stuff /   return 0; } Then we call the function as below: int x=42; Int y=19; do_something(x,y); In this case, a &amp; b in the function declaration/definition are the formal parameters, and the values of x &amp; y (42, &amp; 19, respectively) in the function call are the actual parameters.</p> <p>Example function definitions: void say_hello() {   printf(\"Hello!\\n\"); } The function above simply prints \u201cHello\u201d and returns. </p> <p>int add_ten(int x) {   return x + 10; } This function takes a parameter, adds 10 to it, then returns that value. Note that x is not modified. Function arguments are local variables in the function and can be modified, but the value of the actual argument passed to the function does not change. We can also declare local variables inside our function (called automatic variables). These variables are created when the function is called and destroyed when the function returns.</p> <p>The length of an array is not passed to a function by default, so functions that work with arrays should include an argument for the length of the array. Also, any changes made to an array passed in as an argument are made to the original array as well. We will discuss why this is later.</p> <p>Parameter Passing * Call-by-value: a formal parameter is a local variable in the function. It is a copy of the actual parameter that is initialized to the value of the actual parameter. The advantage of call-by-value is that there are no side effects, but it is less \ufb02exible &amp; powerful. * Call-by-reference:  the formal parameter is an alias to the actual parameter, so there is only one variable with two names. Changing the formal parameter immediately changes the actual parameter. The actual parameter must be a variable; it cannot be a value because a value cannot have an alias.  * Call-by-address (pointer):  The formal parameter is the address to the actual parameter. For the address itself, it is like call-by-value (the value of the pointer passed as a parameter doesn\u2019t change). For the variable pointed to by the address, it is like call-by-reference (that value can be changed through the pointer inside the function).  Recursion A recursive definition is one in which the concept being defined is used in the definition. Consider a list of numbers, eg. 24, 88, 40, 37. We can define a list as follows:  A list is:  * A number  * A number followed by a comma followed by a list  </p> <p>The factorial operation can also be defined recursively as follows:</p> <pre><code>    n!=n \u00d7(n-1)!\n</code></pre> <p>A recursive function is a method that calls itself in order to perform a computation. The recursive function must have two parts: 1. A base case that stops the recursion 2. A recursive call (to itself) with a different parameter If there is no base case then the recursion will continue indefinitely. </p> <p>Keep in mind that recursion is a tool, not a goal. It is important to understand when to use recursion and when to avoid it. Iteration can often be more efficient (in computational terms). Every recursive solution has a corresponding iterative solution, though the iterative solution can be significantly more complicated. But even when recursion is not as efficient, it is often clearer and more elegant than an iterative solution. Plus, many modern compilers can efficiently handle tail recursion.</p> <p>It can be difficult to think of how to write recursive functions because it can be hard to trust that the recursion will work. The key is to trust that it will. Usually recursive solutions are much simpler &amp; shorter than you expect. It takes experience, so practice!</p> <p>The diagrams below show how a recursive factorial function uses stack memory as it completes the computation:</p> <p>The recursive call can happen anywhere in the method, but if no additional computation is performed after the recursive call we call that tail-recursion. The structure of a tail-recursive function is similar to a while loop. </p> <p>Tail-recursion can be handled efficiently by modern compilers - since the current call stack does not need to be kept, the compiler can optimize it to a while loop. For factorial, notice how in the example above we have to multiply the result of the recursive call by n each time. In contrast, notice how the tail-recursive factorial function below computes the result after it makes the final recursive call - no additional computation is needed. A tail-recursive solution is similar in structure to an iterative solution such as a while loop since once the base case is reached no further computation is performed.</p> <p>Implementing Recursion The following steps for writing recursive functions were mentioned in a comment by DonaldPShimoda on HackerNews. It is probably the best summary of writing recursive methods. 1. Write down what your function does in a comment. (e.g., \"sum all the elements of a binary tree\").  2. Write the function signature.  3. Write the base case. (This is usually straightforward.)  4. Stop thinking.  5. Assume your function already works and write the recursive case.  6. Profit! Fibonacci numbers The Fibonacci numbers are a series of numbers where each number in the sequence is the sum of the previous two numbers. Here are 3 implementations of a function that will return the nth Fibonacci number:</p> <p>Iterative - using a while loop: int fibwhile(int n) {   int f=1, f1 = 1, f2 = 1;   int ii=n;   while (ii &gt; 2) {     f = f1 + f2;     f2 = f1;     f1 = f;     ii--;   }   return f; }</p> <p>Recursive: int fib(int n) {    counter[n]++;    if (n &lt;=0) {       return 0;    }    else if (n == 1) {       return 1;    }    else {       return (fib(n-1) + (fib(n-2)));    } }</p> <p>Tail-Recursive: int fibtail(int n) {   return fibtail_helper(n, 0, 1); } int fibtail_helper(int n, int f2, int f1)   {   counter[n]++;   if (n &lt;= 1) {     return f1;   }   else {     return(fibtail_helper(n-1, f1, f1+f2));   } }</p> <p>Towers of Hanoi In the Towers of Hanoi game, the goal is to move all disks from one peg to another with the following constraints: 1. You can only move one peg at a time 2. A larger disk cannot be placed on a smaller disk 3. All disks must be on some peg (except when being moved)</p> <p>It turns out that there is a very straightforward recursive solution to the Towers of Hanoi game. Suppose we want to move all the disks from a source peg to a destination peg. Then the recursive algorithm is as follows: * Base Case:  Only one disk    * Move from source to destination * Recursive Case:    * Move n-1 disks from source to intermediate    * Move one disk from source to destination    * Move n-1 disks from intermediate to destination</p> <p>Unfortunately, the number of moves grows exponentially as the number of disks increases. Our recursive solution is simple &amp; elegant, but is not optimally efficient. Of course, while the iterative solution is more efficient, it is also much more complex to implement. See - trade-offs.</p> <p>Merge Sort Another recursive algorithm is merge sort. Merge sort sorts an array by splitting it into two halves, recursively sorting the two halves, then combining the two sorted halves. The base case is an array of length one which is trivially sorted.  The following is an example of merge sort. We start by breaking the array up into individual elements, then we recursively combine the parts, sorting as we go.</p> <p>Now we merge the arrays back, ensuring that each combined array is sorted.</p> <p>Structures (Chapter 8) A C struct allows you to combine multiple fields of data in a single type. struct date {   int month;   int day;   int year; }; Defining a struct does not allocate any memory. In order to do that, we need to declare a variable of type date as follows: struct date birthday; struct date first_day= {5, 29, 2019}; struct date new_years_day= {.month=1, .day=1}; To access the individual structure members, use . birthday.month = 6; birthday.day = 9; birthday.year = 1998;       You can set an existing structure variable using a compound literal: final_exam = (struct date) { .month=7, .day=17, .year=2019;        </p> <p>You can create an array of structures. Structures can contain array members and struct members.</p> <p>Structure Alignment  One thing you should keep in mind when creating structs is how your compiler allocates memory. It is common for the members of a struct to be allocated in order in memory. Since most architectures do not allow variables to cross word boundaries, a lot of memory  can be wasted. Here is an example of the memory allocation of two different declarations of a struct - both with 3 integers and 4 characters. </p> <p>The size of tightstruct will be 16 bytes (assuming 32-bit words).</p> <p>The size of loosestruct will be 28 bytes (assuming 32-bit words).</p> <p>Linked Lists The diagram below demonstrates how the basiclist example works.</p> <p>Characters &amp; Strings (Chapter 9) Character literals are single-quoted: 'a', '\\n', '\\t'. The last two are also single characters referred to as escape sequences. Using the backslash character allows us to represent characters like newline and tab. Keep in mind that the char data type is an integer - the variable holds the ASCII value of the character. So we can do things like: char a = 'a'; char d = c + 3; int order = d - 'a'; We can use ((c &gt;= 'A')  &amp;&amp; (c &lt;= 'Z')) to check that a character is an uppercase letter.</p> <p>String literals are double quoted: \u201cThis is a string\u201d.  Note that most word processors automatically convert both single and double quotes to smart quotes. Copy-and-pasting code from a word processor may generate syntax errors due to the different quote characters used. C stores strings in char arrays with a null character at the end. There is an implicit null character (\u2018\\0\u2019) at the end of each string literal. </p> <p>We can initialize a string array with an array initializer or a string literal: char carr1[] = {'H','e','l','l','o'}; char carr2[] = \"world\"; Following the declarations above, carr1 is a character array of length 5. But carr2 is a character string of length 6 because the string literal adds a null character at the end. We can treat carr2 as a string, but not carr1. To use carr1 as a string we would need to add the null as follows: char carr1[] = {'H','e','l','l','o','\\0'}; This is a critical distinction in C. Without the null character there is no way to determine where the string ends. If we print the string using printf\u2019s %s control sequence or use the string with any of C\u2019s string functions we will likely get unexpected results. </p> <p>The  character can be used to extend a string literal over multiple lines of code without adding a newline inside the string. Consecutive string literals in the source code are automatically concatenated.  Pointers (Chapter 10) One of the most powerful features of C is the pointer data type. Put simply, a pointer is a data type that has memory addresses as its values. Pointers allow the programmer to reference values through indirect addressing. Pointers have many uses in C, including * Dynamically allocating memory * Efficiently working with large, complex data structures * Changing the value of data passed to a function Keep in mind that pointers are variables. So they use memory just like any other variable. The difference is that they store a memory location (of another variable) as their data.</p> <p>The following code defines a pointer and uses it to change a variable\u2019s value. int num = 6;  / integer / int * ptr;    / pointer to an integer (or integer pointer) / ptr = #   / assign the value of the address of num to ptr.                   Now ptr is a pointer to num / ptr = 20;    / Assign the value 20 to the variable pointed to                   by ptr */ The &amp; is the C reference operator. It returns the address of a variable. It is an r-value (it can appear only on the right side of an assignment operator - you cannot assign a value to it and the address of a variable cannot be changed).  The * is the C indirection (dereference) operator. It returns an alias of the variable pointed to by a pointer. It is an l-value (it can appear on either side of the assignment operator - you can assign a value to it). No additional memory overhead is incurred when using a pointer as an alias. One advantage of using an alias is you can write code that can work on different variables at different times depending on what the alias is referring to.</p> <p>Note that while this example shows x and ptr being stored together in memory, the order and spacing between variables is compiler &amp; operating system dependent. The only memory guaranteed to be contiguous by the C standard is the individual members of an array.</p> <p>The reference operator and the dereference operator are complementary: * converts an address to a variable name  &amp; converts a variable name to an address</p> <p>Note that pointers have a type. A char pointer and an integer pointer pointing to the same location will yield different results. We will use integer pointers to illustrate how pointers work, but they are more often used with structs and arrays. When accessing the members of a struct through a pointer we need to use the -&gt; operator in place of the . operator. </p> <p>When used with a pointer, the const modifier can be used to indicate to the compiler that the data being the pointer refers to will not be changed through the const pointer. We can also use the const modifier to indicate that the pointer itself will not change, preventing us from changing what it is pointing to.</p> <p>We can use pointer types as function parameters. This allows us to modify the actual parameter inside the function. The address of the actual parameter should be passed to the function in this case. We can also return a pointer from a function, but be careful not to return a pointer to a local variable!</p> <p>We can perform some arithmetic with pointers (addition and subtraction). However, when we add 1 to a pointer we do not add one to the address it holds. Instead, we add the size of the type the pointer points to. So typically adding 1 to a char pointer will add one to its address, but adding 1 to an int pointer will add 4, 8 or even more to the address the pointer holds, depending on the size of the int type.</p> <p>We can also use pointers to access arrays. We can either set the value of the pointer to the array name or the address of the first element of the array: int arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}; int * ptr; ptr = arr;   / equivalent to: ptr = &amp;arr[0] / We can then use pointer arithmetic to access the elements of array arr through ptr. The increment and decrement operators (++ and --) can be used to move back and forth through an array using a pointer. </p> <p>Finally, it is also possible to have a pointer to a function. This is helpful in cases where you want to pass a function as a parameter to another function. This is used extensively in implementing object-oriented languages in C, or even for writing object-oriented programs using C.</p> <p>Dynamic Memory Allocation (from Chapter 16) Many times the programmer does not know how much memory will be required. In this case, C lets the programmer allocate memory using one of the two functions below: * calloc(number_ofunits, unit_size) returns a void pointer to a region of memory large enough to hold number_of_units elements of size unit_size. The entire region is filled with 0s. * malloc(number_of_bytes) returns a void pointer to a region of memory of size number_of_bytes. It does not initialize the memory.  The sizeof operator returns the number of bytes allocated to an item. Since the size of different types varies on different machines, the sizeof operator can be used to ensure enough memory is allocated. ptr1 = calloc(20, sizeof(char));        / Allocate 20 integers and                                        initialize to 0 / ptr2 = malloc(10);                    / Allocate 10 bytes / nums = malloc(10 * sizeof(int));        / Allocate 10 integers /</p> <p>When using sizeof to determine the size of an array, you need to divide the size of the array by the type the array holds. item_count = sizeof(item_list) / sizeof(int);</p> <p>When you are finished working with dynamically allocated memory you should always free them memory using the free function. free(ptr1);</p> <p>When working with pointers it is imperative that you ensure that any pointer you try to dereference is pointing to allocated memory. Look at the following program: </p>","text":"","boost":1},{"location":"csc240/c/c1-notes/#include_1","title":"include","text":"","boost":1},{"location":"csc240/c/c1-notes/#include_2","title":"include <p>int main(void) {    int x = 10;    int ptr1 = &amp;x;    int ptr2 = malloc(sizeof(int));    int ptr3;     printf(\"x=%d &amp;x=%p  ptr1=%p  &amp;ptr1=%p ptr1=%d\\n\",            x, &amp;x, ptr1, &amp;ptr1, ptr1);    printf(\"x=%d &amp;x=%p  ptr2=%p  &amp;ptr2=%p ptr2=%d\\n\",            x, &amp;x, ptr2, &amp;ptr2, ptr2);    /printf(\"x=%d &amp;x=%p  ptr3=%p  &amp;ptr3=%p ptr3=%d\\n\",              x, &amp;x, ptr3, &amp;ptr3, ptr3); */    free(ptr2);    return 0;  }  With ptr1 we set it to the address of variable x, so it points to x. We allocate new memory for ptr2 using the malloc function (which allocates the given number of bytes, in this case the number of bytes the int type uses). We don\u2019t initialize ptr3. We don\u2019t have any problem using ptr1 or ptr2 since they both point to allocated memory - ptr1 memory that was allocated for variable x, ptr2 for memory allocated just for that variable which is why we must free it when we are done. We had to comment out the output line for ptr3 since we did not initialize it. Therefore, we can\u2019t know what it is pointing to. Usually it is not going to point to anything valid, so when we try to dereference it we will get unexpected behavior. In most cases the program will crash as your operating system does not like to give your programs access to random locations in memory! </p> <p>Pointer Example 1:</p> <p>In this example, when we reach the code the value stored in x is 500 and the value stored in y is 8000. We aren't concerned with where those values came from, just that the variables have that value now.</p> <p>y = &amp;x; In this line, &amp;x returns the address where x is stored (which we are told is 2000 in the example). So y will now hold the value 2000. The value held in x does not change. </p> <p>y = 100; Here we dereference y, which means y is an alias of the variable y is pointing to. The value held in y is 2000 which is the address of x. Therefore, *y is an alias of x so the statement assigned the value 100 to x. Now x holds the value 100. </p> <p>y = y + 10; This line is an example of pointer arithmetic. When we add or subtract a value from a pointer, we change the value stored by the pointer. However, we don\u2019t just add or subtract the value. The actual value we add or subtract is based on the size of the type of the pointer. Here y is an int pointer and ints are 4 bytes. So when we have y + 10 we are adding 10 * 4 = 40 to y since each byte is 4. This is convenient because it allows us to cycle through an array quickly using a pointer.</p> <p>Pointer Example 2:</p> <p>Pointer Example 3:</p> <p>In this example, we see a pointer to a pointer (double pointer) - k. A double pointer holds the address of a pointer as its value, so *k is an alias for j. k is an alias for i. You can have multiple levels of indirection, but in practice anything more than a double pointer is rare.</p> <p>Why pointers?  In a typical program you should not use pointers unless you have a good reason. Some of the reasons to use pointers are:  * Pointers allow you to manipulate memory much more quickly than any other language construct  * If your program needs to dynamically allocate array you need to use pointers  * Passing a pointer allows a large data structure to be used in a function without having to be copied - you can just reference it using the pointer But to reiterate, you should not use pointers unless you have a good reason. </p> <p>Pointers vs Arrays It may seem like pointers and arrays are the same thing. After all, pointer names can be used with array indexing, so p is equivalent to &amp;p[0] p is equivalent to p[0] (p+3) is equivalent to p[3] Conversely, array names can be used syntactically as pointer names. So arr is equivalent to &amp;arr[0] *(arr+3) is equivalent to arr[3] However, while we can use the name of a pointer and an array interchangeably, at least syntactically, pointers and arrays are not equivalent. A pointer is a variable that holds an address - only enough memory to hold an address is allocated. An array variable allocates all the memory necessary to hold the array. In addition, a pointer is an rvalue (you can assign a new value to it), while an array is an lvalue (you cannot assign a new value to it).</p> <p>Pointer Type vs Unsigned Int  * Both typically have the same data range (32 or 64 bits)  * Both support + and - operators  * But the operations have different meanings!  * Pointer type does not support * (multiply) and /  * Unsigned int does not support * (dereference)  </p> <p>Bit Operations (Chapter 11) Systems programmers often need to work with memory at the individual bit level. A byte consists of 8 bits. Each bit can have the value 1 or 0. We call the rightmost bit of a byte the least significant or low-order bit, and the leftmost bit is called the most significant or high-order bit. </p> <p>Representation of numbers in binary Positive integers are typically represented by converting them to binary. With negative numbers, most computers use two's complement notation where the leftmost bit is the sign bit.  To convert a negative number from decimal to binary we add 1 to the value, convert to binary,  then change all the 1\u2019s to 0\u2019s and the 0's to 1\u2019s.  To convert a negative binary number to decimal, we complement the bits, convert to decimal, then subtract 1. Integers are typically represented by four or eight contiguous bytes (32 bits). </p> <p>Bit operators:         &amp; - bitwise AND         | - bitwise OR         ^ - bitwise exclusive OR         &lt;&lt; - left shift         &gt;&gt; - right shift There is also a unary ones complement operator ~. These operators are valid on any integer type.  The C Preprocessor (Chapter 12) Before a C program is compiled, it is first analyzed by the preprocessor. Preprocessor statements are prefixed by the pound sign - #. The preprocessor, when used properly, allows you to write programs that are easier to develop, modify, and port to different systems. Preprocessor statements have a slightly different syntax than regular C statements.</p> <p>The -E gcc flag will generate the C file after the preprocessor runs. This is useful for seeing how preprocessor statements work and for debugging them.</p> <p>The #define statement assigns a symbolic name to a constant (a symbolic constant). They are sometimes called macros. While they can appear anywhere in the code, by convention they appear near the top of the source file. The convention is to use all caps for preprocessor constants. Note that, unlike a const variable, no memory is allocated by a #define. You cannot assign a value to a preprocessor constant. So the following statements</p>","text":"","boost":1},{"location":"csc240/c/c1-notes/#define-num-10","title":"define NUM 10","text":"","boost":1},{"location":"csc240/c/c1-notes/#define-name-clint-barton","title":"define NAME \"Clint Barton\" <p>define two symbolic constants. Note that the statements are not terminated by a semicolon. In code, the statement printf(\"Name=%s, Num=%d\\n\", NAME, NUM); would be converted by the preprocessor to the statement printf(\"Name=%s, Num=%d\\n\", \"Clint Barton\", 10); before the compilation begins. Many compilers define NULL and pi (M_PI in math.h). One common use of preprocessor constants is to define array sizes. This allows the size to be changed with only a single line of code. </p> <p>The preprocessor performs a literal replacement of the name with the value in the source. So you can define constants to represent operations, though if you choose to do so you should make sure the name makes the operation clear. </p> <p>You can also define macros that take arguments, creating inline functions. The advantage of inline functions is that there is no function-call overhead since the inline function is converted to code before compilation. In this case, the arguments will be replaced in the macro when the code is replaced by the preprocessor.  So code like below: </p>","text":"","boost":1},{"location":"csc240/c/c1-notes/#define-maxval-100","title":"define MAXVAL 100","text":"","boost":1},{"location":"csc240/c/c1-notes/#define-quadfnab-asqrtb-bb-2aa","title":"define QUADFN(a,b) asqrt(b) + bb - 2aa <p>x = MAXVAL + QUADFN(5,16);  becomes  x = 100 + 5sqrt(16) + 1616 - 255; </p> <p>Again, great care should be taken not to write macros that introduce subtle bugs. Suppose you have the following inline function:</p>","text":"","boost":1},{"location":"csc240/c/c1-notes/#define-absa-a0-a-a","title":"define abs(a)  ((a&lt;0) ? -(a) : (a)) <p>Then k=abs(3); is equivalent to: k=(3 &lt; 0) ? \u2013(3) : (3); But k=abs(++j); is equivalent to: k=((++j &lt; 0) ? \u2013(++j) : (++j); You will note that since ++j performs an assignment, the variable j is modified twice in this case. </p> <p>The number of arguments to a macro can be variable. The arguments can be accessed using the VA_ARGS identifier. </p> <p>The #include statement allows us to include statements from another file into our C program.

Enumerated data types allow us to specify the valid values for a type. For example, we can define a \u201cdays of the week\u201d type as follows: enum week_day { sunday, monday, tuesday, wednesday,                    thursday, friday, saturday}; This creates a new enumerated data type called enum week_day. We can then define and use a variable of this type as follows: enum week_day workday = monday; / ... / if ( workday == friday ) {   workday = monday; } Enumerated data types are integer types. The specified names are assigned integer values starting with 0. So in our week_day_t enum sunday=0, thursday=4 and saturday=6. We can assign our own values when we create the enum. enum direction { south = 180, north = 0, east = 90, west = 270 };</p> <p>The scope rules for enumerated data types are the same as with structs or variable declarations. Keep in mind that if you print an enumerated data type the result will be an integer, not the name. If you want to use the name as input or output you will need to write your own functions to handle that conversion. In general, enumerated data types should not be treated as integers and their underlying values should not be assumed. For example, in our direction type above, if we want to change the direction a variable holds we should use the names, not the values. Finally, the names in the enumerated data type are treated as constants in the program, so those names should not be reused anywhere the eum is in scope. Defining Types When we defined structs and enums above we needed to specify in the variable declaration that we were using a struct or enum. For example, in the previous section we declared a direction variable as enum direction current_direction = north; not direction current_direction = north; C lets us define a new type name using the typedef statement. The format is typedef double real; The typedef statement adds readability to the code. The compiler will treat the variable \u201creal\u201d as a double. We can use typedef to simplify how we use our direction enumeration above: typedef enum { south = 180, north = 0,                 east = 90, west = 270 } direction_t; Then we can define a direction variable as follows: direction_t current_direction = north;</p> <p>We can define array and struct types as follows: typedef int grades_t[10]; typedef struct { float x; float y; } point_t;</p> <p>grades_t cs_grades;  / Array of 10 ints / point_t current_loc; / Point /</p> <p>Clear naming of user-defined types is critical, as the typedef hides the details of the type. The name should indicate what the underlying type is For example typedef char *string_pointer_t; typedef struct {int id, char * name} student_record_t; are a good names, but typedef int my_type_t[23]; typedef struct {int id, char * name} thing_t; are not. Type Conversion The C compiler has a series of steps it takes when determining how to convert types from one to the other. It is best to write code that avoids implicit type conversion as much as possible, but you should familiarize yourself with the rules just in case. Working with Large Programs (Chapter 14) Most C programs are too large to be manageable in a single file. In industry, programs are usually developed by more than one programmer. C provides a mechanism to facilitate breaking code across multiple files.  C supports modular programming where programs can be combined into modules - functions or related functions logically grouped together in individual files. The benefits of modules are data abstraction, code sharing (libraries) and separate compilation. C is flexible about how you create modules.  Best practice is to create a specification in a header (.h) file with any forward declarations and symbolic constants provided by the module (similar to the public members of a Java object) . The implementation is provided in a C source file with the definitions. The C file can also contain functions that are \u201cprivate\u201d, that is they are not intended to be used outside the module. </p> <p>When using a module, the module code must be linked with the source code. To create an executable called \u201cmyprogram\u201d based on myprogram.c which uses the modules mymath and mystuff you would compile with the following gcc command (carefully note the extensions used!): gcc myprogram.c mymath.c mystuff.c -o myprogram myprogram.c should contain</p>","text":"","boost":1},{"location":"csc240/c/c1-notes/#include_4","title":"include <p>An alternate way to compile your program would be to first generate object files of each module as follows: gcc -c mymath.c gcc -c mystuff.c Then you can build your code by linking the object files: gcc myprogram.c mymath.o mystuff.o Communication Between Modules We have already discussed how you can provide functions from a module by including their forward declarations in a header file. Functions in separate files can also access (and change) the same variable by using external variables. To access an external variable, use the extern keyword in the variable declaration: extern int counter; Keep in mind the declaration above is not a definition. The variable must be defined somewhere either by omitting the extern keyword in the declaration or by initializing the variable as follows: extern int counter = 0; To prevent a global variable from being declared as external implicitly (which is the default) you can declare it as static: static int local_counter = 0; Functions can also be defined as static to prevent them from being called outside the module. It is a good idea to always use static to declare global variables that should not be available outside the module where they are defined.  Utilities for working with large programs There are several utilities that allow you to simplify the process of building multi-file programs. The make utility allows you to specify how to build a particular program and what other files (dependencies) need to be included (discussed below). It is also a good idea to use some sort of source code management to manage your source code such as cvs, svn, or git. Finally, Unix provides multiple utilities such as grep and sed which allow you to work with source code (as well as any text file).  Makefiles The make utility is designed to automatically determine how a program should be compiled then to execute the correct commands to perform that compilation. It also intelligently determines what parts of the program need to be compiled in cases where there are multiple files. The input to make is a makefile which contains the directions for building the program. </p> <p>The make utility is executed by typing make in the directory that contains the makefile. The makefile contains a list of rules that tell the make utility what to do. There are two parts to each rule: 1. The dependency line (which must start in column 1) 2. A list of actions (which must be indented with a tab) The sample makefile below has 2 rules - one to build a program called \u201cmyprogram\u201d and another to build an object file called goodstuff.o. Note that goodstuff.o is a dependency of myprogram, so it will be automatically built by make if necessary when you build myprogram. myprogram: myprogram.c .o goodstuff.o     gcc --std=c11 -Wall -pedantic myprogram.c .o goodstuff.o goodstuff.o:      gcc --std=c11 -Wall -pedantic -c goodstuff.c In order to build myprogram, you would execute the following command: make myprogram You could also generated the goodstuff.o object file by entering the command make goodstuff.o</p> <p>If you add a rule for \u201call\u201d to your make file, then simply typing make at the command line will build everything needed to generate the program executable.</p> <p>You can also use variables to avoid having to retype the same things over and over. That is often used for the compiler command and compiler flags. You can also have a rule that executes shell commands, useful to create a rule to clean up after the compiler or to force everything to rebuild. </p> <p>Below is a sample makefile for a project that includes 4 C files - poly.c, term.c, polynomial.c, and basiclist.c. The \u201call\u201d rule builds the whole project, then there is a separate rule for each of the modules term.c, polynomial.c, and basiclist.c. The rule \u201cclean\u201d deletes all object files, backup files, and .exe files (in cases where this is compiled on Windows). Note that there are two variables defined at the top - one for the name of the compile command and another for the flags for the compiler.  CC=gcc CFLAGS=-Wall -pedantic --std=c11 all: poly.c term.o polynomial.o basiclist.o         $(CC) $(CFLAGS) poly.c term.o polynomial.o basiclist.o -o poly term.o: term.c         $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c term.c polynomial.o: polynomial.c         $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c polynomial.c basiclist.o: basiclist.c         $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c basiclist.c clean:         rm -f .o ~ poly.exe To build the whole project make To build just one module (in this case term.o) make term.o To clean the directory make clean C I/O (Chapter 15) The C language itself does not provide input / output (I/O) operations, but the C library contains several I/O functions. The stdio.h header file includes function declarations and macro definitions for the standard library I/O routines.</p> <p>Character I/O is performed using the getchar() and putchar() functions. These functions work one character at a time. The  putchar takes a single character as an argument and displays that character. </p> <p>Formatted I/O is performed using the printf() and scanf() functions. Both of these functions take a string pointer to a format string as their first argument. The format string specifies how the remaining arguments to the function are to be interpreted. Scanf ignores any leading whitespace if a non-character type is read. Scanf returns the number of variables it read &amp; assigned. We have already covered many of the control sequences printf &amp; scanf use. There are several other flags and modifiers available such as justification, field size, and additional types. Any good C reference will provide a listing of these. The code examples from class will cover all the ones you will be expected to use in your code for this class. </p> <p>Note that scanf will read a string (%s), but only up to the first whitespace. To read an entire string to the end of the line (necessary for getting input) use fgets. fgets(movie-&gt;title, TITLE_LEN, stdin); The first parameter is a pointer to your string (in this case I have a pointer to a structure of type movie_t and I'm passing a character array member of movie_t called \"title\"), the # of characters to read, and the filename. stdin is a special file that represents user input.</p> <p>Input &amp; Output Operations with Files One way to write output to a file is to use your operating system\u2019s redirect operator. For example, the line below writes the output of myprogram.exe to a file called \u201coutput.txt\u201d:         ./myprogram.exe &gt; output.txt Note that this redirects all output to the file, so if you have any prompts for input those will not be displayed to the screen. There is a similar technique that we can use to provide input to our program:         ./myprogram.exe &lt; input.txt Note that the direction of the operator is reversed. In this case, the file will be treated as the input of our program. </p> <p>The above operations were done using the operating system, not the C language. C provides functions to write directly to and read from a file from inside our program. Note that when dealing with files we need to be concerned about the end of the file. If we read from a file past the end of the file we will get an error. Most C library file functions use a special flag (EOF) to indicate when the end of the file is reached. You should always check that flag in your programs when you use file I/O.</p> <p>Before you can perform I/O on a file the file must be opened. The fopen function opens a file and returns a FILE pointer to the file. You must specify the mode you want to use the file for - read (\u201cr\u201d), write(\u201cw\u201d), or append (\u201ca\u201d). Append and write mode will create the file if it does not already exist. You can read from anywhere in a file, but you can only write to the end. Adding a + character to the mode will allow both reading &amp; writing. Adding a b to the mode will open the file in binary mode. If the file cannot be opened the function returns NULL. You should always check that the file was opened successfully before proceeding. FILE infile, outfile, binaryfile; if ( (infile = fopen(\u201cinput.txt\u201d, \u201cr\u201d)) ==  NULL ) {     / Input file was not opened /      exit(EXIT_FAILURE); } if ( (outfile = fopen(\u201coutput.txt\u201d, \u201cw+\u201d)) ==  NULL ) {     / Output file was not opened /     exit(EXIT_FAILURE); } if ( (binaryfile = fopen(\u201cmyfile\u201d, \u201cwb+\u201d)) ==  NULL ) {     / My file was not opened */     exit(EXIT_FAILURE); } The code above opens input.txt for reading and myfile for both reading &amp; writing in binary mode. The exit function is used to force the program to terminate. The EXIT_FAILURE value is defined in stdlib.h and indicates to the OS that the program failed. EXIT_SUCCESS is used to indicate a successful termination. You can also specify your own integer value. Using the exit() function in main() is the same as return(); When you are done with a file you should always close it.  fclose(infile); fclose(outfile); fclose(binaryfile);</p> <p>Once we have opened a file, C provides several methods for writing to the file. Also, the standard streams (stdin, stdout, stderr) can also be used in place of a file. </p> <p>You can use getc &amp; putc to write a single character to a file: c = getc(infile); putc('\\n', outfile); The return type of getc is an int and returns EOF when you reach the end of the file. There are also file versions of the I/O functions you have already seen. The functions fprintf, sprintf, fgets, and fputs work just like you would expect except that they take an additional parameter for a file pointer. .</p> <p>The function rename(filename, newname) renames a file and remove(filename) deletes a file. A nonzero value is returned when these functions fail. Advanced C Features (Chapter 16) C provides a goto statement. In general, you should not use goto for flow control. However, there are places where goto statements can make the code more readable or more efficient.  if (myptr == NULL) {   goto handle_error; } / \u2026 / handle_error : printf(\"There was a problem!\");</p> <p>Using Semicolons &amp; Commas A semicolon can be placed anywhere a legal statement can appear. This causes nothing to be done and is called a null statement. This is most often seen in a loop. For example, the following code counts  the number of characters that appear in the file: fileptr = fopen(\"input.txt\", \"r\"); int count = 0; for ( ; getc(fileptr) != EOF; count++)     ; printf(\"The number of characters in the file is %d\\n\", count); fclose(fileptr); All the work is done in the for statement - we get a file and increment the count. Since there is nothing to do in the loop, we use a null-statement. The reason we declare count outside the for statement is so that it is in scope when we get to the printf.</p> <p>Commas are also operators in C. They have the lowest precedence of any operator. We could write a while loop to add up an array using the comma operator: int jj = 0, sum = 0; while ( jj &lt; 10 ) {     sum += arr[jj], ++jj; }</p> <p>Unions A C union is used when it is necessary to store different data types in the same memory location.  union my_union {   int x;   char s[20]; }; Unions are similar to structs, but, unlike a struct, only enough memory is allocated for a union variable to hold the largest member. So in the example above, a union my_union variable would allocate enough memory for 20 characters. Then the variable could be used to hold either an int or a char array, but not both at the same time. </p> <p>Type Qualifiers C provides several type qualifiers to give the compiler more information about the way you intend to use the variable. What actually happens with these type qualifiers is compiler &amp; machine dependent.  * register requests the compiler to be stored in one of the one of the machines registers to speed up execution.  * volatile tells the compiler that the variable will change its value to prevent optimizations that remove assignments that the compiler views as redundant.  * restrict is used in pointer declarations to indicate that it is the only pointer to the memory it is pointing to. </p> <p>Command-line Arguments We have seen how to get information into your program from user input and from files. Another way is via command-line arguments. When you execute your program, the operating system passes two parameters to main. The first, argc, is an integer that specifies the number of command-line arguments (including the executable name). The second, argv, is an array of character pointers to the command line parameters, where argv[0] is the name of the command and argv[1] through argv[n] are the parameters. Keep in mind that the arguments are stored as strings, so if you expect numeric input they will need to be converted to the correct type. The program below prints each of the command line arguments:</p>","text":"","boost":1},{"location":"csc240/c/c1-notes/#include_5","title":"include <p>int main(int argc, char * argv[]) {</p> <p>int ii;   / Print the number of arguments passed /   printf(\"argc = %d\\n\", argc);   / Print each individual argument. arg[0] is the name of the command /   for(ii=0;ii&lt;argc;ii++) {     printf(\"argv[%d] = %s\\n\", ii, argv[ii]);   }    return 0; } Debugging (Chapter 17) Debugging with the preprocessor One way to get debugging output from a C program is to use preprocessor directives to enable debugging code to be enabled or disabled as desired. In the example below, we use the symbol DEBUG to determine whether to compile the debug statements. </p>","text":"","boost":1},{"location":"csc240/c/c1-notes/#ifdef-debug_1","title":"ifdef DEBUG <p>fprintf(stderr, \"Debug: y=%d\\n\", y);</p>","text":"","boost":1},{"location":"csc240/c/c1-notes/#endif_3","title":"endif <p>If the DEBUG symbol is defined, either with a #define or by using the -D flag to gcc, then the debug statement will be printed. Otherwise, nothing will print. This allows the programmer to decide at compile time whether or not to print the debug statements.  You could also write an inline function that will only display debug statements if the DEBUG symbol is defined as follows:</p>","text":"","boost":1},{"location":"csc240/c/c1-notes/#ifdef-debug_2","title":"ifdef DEBUG","text":"","boost":1},{"location":"csc240/c/c1-notes/#define-printdebugfmt-fprintfstderr-fmt-va_args","title":"define PRINTDEBUG(fmt, ...)  fprintf(stderr, fmt, VA_ARGS)","text":"","boost":1},{"location":"csc240/c/c1-notes/#else_1","title":"else","text":"","boost":1},{"location":"csc240/c/c1-notes/#define-printdebugfmt","title":"define PRINTDEBUG(fmt, ...)","text":"","boost":1},{"location":"csc240/c/c1-notes/#endif_4","title":"endif <p>PRINTDEBUG(\"  DEBUG %d\", x); In the code above we need the else case so that any call to PRINTDEBUG in the code will evaluate to a null statement during the preprocessor step.</p> <p>Debugging using the GNU debugger You can always track down bugs using print statements (printf or cout). Also writing to a log file can be helpful, especially once a program is in production. For more subtle bugs you will want to use a debugger. </p> <p>In order to use gdb to debug, you will need to compile with the -g option gcc -pedantic -Wall gdbtest.c -g</p> <p>The \u201cgdb\u201d command is used to start gdb. gdb runs in interactive mode. You issue commands similar to a shell prompt.

We will not cover all the functions in the C standard library, but you should be able to look at a reference and use them in your code where necessary.  * stddef.h contains standard definitions for things like NULL &amp;size_t * limits.h contains implementation-defined minimum and maximum values for different integral types. For example, the valid values of the int type range from INT_MIN through INT_MAX. * stdbool.h contains definitions for Boolean variables.  * float.h contains implementation-defined minimum and maximum values for different floating point data types. * stdint.h contains definitions and constants to allow you to work with integers in a more portable fashion. For example, the type int32_t is defined to be exactly 32 bits no matter what platform the code runs on.  * string.h contains functions to perform character array operations.  * stdbool.h contains definitions for Boolean variables.  * ctype.h contains functions dealing with single characters such as checking the type (numeric, space, etc) and its case..  * stdio.h contains functions and defines for working with I/O.  * stdlib.h contains a wide variety of miscellaneous functions, including memory management and functions to convert between types.  * math.h contains math functions and constants  * complex.h contains functions and constants for working with complex numbers</p> <p>string.h The functions on string.h work on character arrays &amp; memory. They take character pointers as parameters. Most of the functions that start with strn also work with non-terminated character arrays since they include a length parameter. In general, strn- functions are preferred when they exist. Some commonly used functions include: * strcmp(str1, str2) compares str1 &amp; str2. It returns a value less than zero if s1 is less than s2, 0 if they are equal, and greater than zero if s1 is greater than s2. * strcmp(str1, str2, n) compares at most n characters of str1 &amp; str2.  * strcpy(str1, str2) copies the string at str2 to str1 and returns a pointer to str1. Note that if str2 is bigger than str1 a buffer overflow will occur. You should never use strcpy()! * strncpy(str1, str2, n) copies at most n characters from str2 to str1 and returns a pointer to str1. * strlen(str1) returns the number of characters in str1, excluding the null character. * strtok(str1, str2) breaks str1 into tokens based on the delimiters in str2. It returns the first token of str1. Delimiters are replaced with NULL as they are encountered. Each subsequent call should pass a null pointer in place of str1 and will return the next token.  * memcmp(ptr1, ptr2, n) compares the n first characters, returning a value less than 0 if ptr1 is less than ptr2, 0 if they are equal, and a value greater than 0 if ptr1 is greater than ptr2. * memcpy(ptr1, ptr2, n) copies n characters from the memory location pointed to by ptr2 to ptr1.  * memmove(ptr1, ptr2, n) copies n characters from the memory location pointed to by ptr2 to ptr1 even if they overlap * memset(ptr1, c, n) sets the first n characters of ptr1 to the character c. Note that the mem- functions treat null characters the same as any regular characters.</p> <p>Compiling with gcc (Appendix C) The C compiler we will use is gcc (which originally stood for GNU C Compiler but now stands for GNU Compiler Collection). An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Eclipse or Visual Studio will let you edit, compile, debug, and run your program all in one application. However, gcc only compiles your code. You will have to edit your code in the editor of your choice, as long as it will save your code in raw text format. Visual Studio Code is an excellent choice, as is Notepad++. </p> <p>The general format of the gcc command is: gcc [ options ] file1 [ file2 \u2026.] Gcc will compile and link all files listed on the command line. Keep in mind that you do not have to compile header files as they are included in the source code that uses them. </p> <p>The primary options we will use are the following: -std=c11                 Specifies the standard to use (in this case c11) -Wall                 Display all warnings -pedantic                 Checks that the code does include any allowable language  extensions that are not required by the language standard The options above ensure that our code is compliant with the 2011 C standard. A list of other helpful options is included later in this section. You should get in the habit of always fixing warnings unless you are sure they will not cause any problems. And even if you are sure, you should try to fix them as warnings nearly always indicate a bug.</p> <p>To compile and run your code, first edit it (in your favorite text editor) and save it to the file system. Then using a terminal, navigate to the directory where your code is stored. On Windows, the easiest way is to first change to the root of the disk you saved your file on using one of the commands below: * cd c: (Cygwin) * cd /mnt/c (Ubuntu for Windows) * On MacOS or Linux you can change directly do the directory with the cd command</p> <p>The book has a list of gcc options (also called switches). You can also use the command man gcc to display the valid options. The most common ones we will use in class are -c                         Do not link the files, instead save the object files (.o). -g                         Include debugging information (used with gdb) -D id                        Defines id with a value of 1 -D id=value         Defines id with a value of value -E                         Run the preprocessor -o filename                Generate an executable named filename instead of a.out or a.exe -std=c99                 Specifies the standard to use (in this case c99) -Wall                 Display all warnings -Wextra                 Display extra warnings not included in Wall -Wconversion        Display warnings related to implicit conversion -llib                        Link in library lib -S                         Generate assembly code -ON                         Optimization level N -v                         Show verbose output --version                Display the version and copyright notice</p> <p>Examples: You can compile project.c &amp; basiclist.c into an executable called proj2 like this: gcc -std=c11 -pedantic -Wall project.c basiclist.c -o proj2 You can generate an object file (basiclist.o) from basiclist.c with the command gcc -std=c11 -pedantic -Wall basiclist.c -c Once you\u2019ve done that, if you change project.c you can recompile your project with the command gcc -std=c11 -pedantic -Wall project.c basiclist.o -o proj2 This will use basiclist.o to build proj2 without recompiling basiclist.c.</p> <p>Common Programming Mistakes (Appendix D) Common Programming Pitfalls As you write your code, try to avoid the following types of (very common) errors that programmers make: * Random Walk Programming is making small, random changes until your code compiles. This is a bad habit!  When you find an error you should always try to figure out why the error occurred and then fix it in a way that ensures it is really fixed. Keep in mind that just because your code compiles that doesn\u2019t mean it will work. * Cargo Cult Programming / Magical Incantations is copying and pasting code you don\u2019t understand. If you don\u2019t understand code you should never include it - it could be dangerous. * Big Ball of Mud is \u201cA haphazardly structured, sprawling, sloppy, duct-tape-and-baling-wire, spaghetti-code jungle.\u201d  Big balls of mud usually result when you start programming before fully understanding the requirements without a good design and frequently incorporate the 2 problems above.</p>","text":"","boost":1},{"location":"howtos/","title":"How-Tos - Index","text":"<ul> <li>How-Tos - CSC110</li> <li>How-Tos - CSC205</li> <li>How-Tos - CSC240</li> </ul>","boost":1},{"location":"howtos/howtos-csc110/","title":"How-Tos - CSC110","text":"","boost":1},{"location":"howtos/howtos-csc110/#wade-hubers-github-codeexamples-csc110examples-and-youtube","title":"Wade Huber's GitHub CodeExamples, csc110examples, and Youtube","text":"<p>https://github.com/wadehuber/codeexamples</p> <p>https://github.com/wadehuber/csc110examples</p> <p>https://www.youtube.com/@logiclambda</p>","boost":1},{"location":"howtos/howtos-csc205/","title":"How-Tos - CSC205","text":"","boost":1},{"location":"howtos/howtos-csc205/#wade-hubers-github-codeexamples-csc205codeexamples-and-youtube","title":"Wade Huber's GitHub CodeExamples, csc205codeexamples, and Youtube","text":"<p>https://www.youtube.com/@logiclambda</p> <p>https://github.com/wadehuber/codeexamples</p> <p>https://github.com/wadehuber/csc205codeexamples</p> <p>Note</p> <p>The csc205codeexamples is a private GitHub repository.

Look at the coefficients closely, they exactly match the binary representation: 101.</p> <p>As you can see, we start from 0 as before, then comes 1, and then 10. So, binary counting goes like this: when a digit reaches 1, the next number resets this digit to 0 and causes the digit to the left to raise. After some practice, it should become more clear.</p> <p>Zero padding</p> <p>Occasionally you will need to work with binary numbers of a fixed length. To achieve this, you can add insignificant zeros to any binary number on the left side, for example, 11 \u2192 0011, 101 \u2192 0101. This operation does not change the number but allows you to format them.</p> <p>You might come across the following formats:</p> <p>triads: 000, 001, 010, and so on;</p> <p>tetrads: 0110, 0111, and so on;</p> <p>8-digit numbers: 00000000, 01010101, and so on.</p> <p>Why &amp; where</p> <p>Almost all modern digital devices use the binary number system. The reason for this lies in the hardware. Computers started using the electronic tubes or relays and then transistors, all of which could be used to represent two states and quickly change from one to the other.</p> <p>Even the computer memory is binary: we either have something in the memory cell or not. It is conventional to group information in 8-digit binary numbers, where each 8-digit number is referred to as a byte. An 8-digit binary number may represent each of 256 possible values from 0 to 255, and can therefore be used for storing a wide variety of data. Such a way of storing information is called the binary code and is used almost everywhere.</p> <p>A good example of a binary code, an English text is usually encoded with ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) code, where each character in the text string was originally represented by a 7-digit binary number (lowercase a is 1100001, and so on\u2026). Later, ASCII was modified and now it uses 8 bits.</p> <p>Colors can also be encoded that way. The RGB (stands for Red, Green, Blue) color encoding system stores 3 binary values, 1 binary number for each color, representing the saturation of red, green, and blue color components respectively. The (11111111, 00000000, 00000000) color, for example, is pure red, with no shade of green or blue.</p> <p>In fact, everything can be (and is) encoded using the binary code.</p>","boost":1},{"location":"programming/","title":"Programming - Index","text":"<ul> <li> <p>Arrays</p> <ul> <li>One-Dimensional Arrays</li> <li>Two-Dimensional Arrays</li> <li>Initializing an Array with Random Unique Values</li> <li>Key Array Skills</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Conditionals and Loops</p> <ul> <li>Conditionals</li> <li>Boolean</li> <li>Logical Operators</li> <li>Relational Operators</li> <li>Basic Truth Tables Using Boolean Values Of True and False</li> <li>The getYorN() Method</li> <li>Loops - Three Types of Loops - The Do-While Loop, The While Loop, And The For Loop</li> <li>Counting Pre-Test Loop (While Loop) And Counting Post-Test Loop (Do-While Loop)</li> <li>For-Loop (Pre-Test Loop)</li> <li>While-Loop (Pre-Test Loop)</li> <li>Do-While Loop (Post-Test Loop)</li> <li>Game Loop</li> <li>Input While-Loop (Pre-Test Loop) With A Sentinel Value And A Priming Read</li> <li>Standard Input-Sentinel Loop</li> <li>wantsToContinue Loop</li> <li>Nested Loops</li> <li>While Loop General Format In Pseudocode</li> <li>While-Loop Example</li> <li>Which Loop To Use</li> <li>Loops Terminology</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Input Validation</p> <ul> <li>getValidNumber() Template Input Validation</li> <li>isInvalid() Template Input Validation</li> <li>One-Function Input Validation Model</li> <li>Two-function Input Validation Model</li> <li>Validating String Data</li> <li>Examples of Common String Library Functions</li> <li>Common Input Values To Test For</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Menus</p> <ul> <li>Practice Menu</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Methods</p> <ul> <li>The getString() Method</li> <li>The getInteger() Method</li> <li>The getDouble() Method</li> <li>The getYorN() Method</li> <li>The closeScanner() Method</li> <li>The getRandomNumber() Method</li> <li>Generalized Input Functions</li> <li>Methods Terminology</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Obejct Oriented Programming</p> <ul> <li>Object-Oriented Programming</li> <li>Object-Oriented Programming Terminology</li> <li>Object-Oriented Programming Review Questions</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Resources</p> <ul> <li>Java<ul> <li>Java Programming Resources</li> <li>Installing The Java Development Kit JDK</li> <li>Glossary</li> </ul> </li> <li>Eclipse IDE<ul> <li>Eclipse IDE: How To Find Matching Brackets and Missing Brackets</li> </ul> </li> <li>Writing<ul> <li>Di\u00e1taxis: A systematic approach to technical documentation authoring</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Ternary</p> <ul> <li>Enhanced For Loops</li> <li>Enhanced If Statements</li> </ul> </li> </ul>","boost":1},{"location":"programming/csc205-activity08-module09-searching/","title":"CSC205 Interpolation Search","text":"","boost":1},{"location":"programming/csc205-activity08-module09-searching/#module-9-activity-8-searching","title":"Module 9 - Activity 8 - Searching","text":"","boost":1},{"location":"programming/csc205-activity08-module09-searching/#given-assignment","title":"Given Assignment","text":"<ol> <li> <p>Add an interpolation search method based on the binary search method to our Searching class.</p> <ul> <li>The Searching class can be found in the example code for this module on GitHub at: https://github.com/wadehuber/csc205codeexamples/tree/master/csc205videoexamples/src/activities/activity8searching</li> </ul> <p>Note</p> <p>The csc205codeexamples is a private GitHub repository.

But a Persian is a Cat which is an Animal, so Persian inherits from Animal.</p> <p>The Animal, Dog, Beagle, Poodle, Cat, and Persian classes can all be created as objects. Here is how the classes are extended and how a method in Animal can be used in Dog and Beagle objects:</p> <pre><code>// Pseudocode\nPublic Class Animal\n    Private String name\n\n    //Constructors\n    Public Module Animal ()\n        name = \"undefined\"\n    End Module\n\n    Public Module Animal (String n)\n        name = n\n    End Module\n\n    //getters and setters\n    Public Module setName(String n)\n        name = n\n    End Module\n\n    Public Function String getname()\n        Return name\n    End Function\nEnd Class\n</code></pre> <p>Note</p> <p>If the function <code>setName()</code> is not in Beagle, but it is in Dog, the function in Dog will be executed. If the function is not in Dog, but it is in Animal, the function in Animal will be executed.</p> <p>Note that Beagle does not contain a <code>name</code> field, but Animal does. So, because Beagle extends Dog which extends Animal, Beagle does have a name field where his name is stored.</p> <pre><code>// Pseudocode\nPublic Class Dog extends Animal\n    //Constructors\n    Public Module Dog ()\n        setName(\"Undefined in Dog\")\n    End Module\n\n    Public Module Dog (String name)\n        setName(name)\n    End Module\nEnd Class\n</code></pre> <p>Note</p> <p>There are two constructors in all three classes.</p> <pre><code>// Pseudocode\nPublic Class Beagle extends Dog\n    //Constructors\n    Public Module Beagle ()\n        setName(\"Undefined in Beagle\")\n    End Module\n\n    Public Module Beagle (String name)\n        setName(name)\n    End Module\nEnd Class\n</code></pre> <p>Note</p> <p>In a driver program, here is how objects could be created: <pre><code>// Pseudocode\nAnimal myAnimal = New Animal ()\nDog myDog = New Dog()\nDog yourDog = New Dog(\"Fido\")\n</code></pre></p>","boost":1},{"location":"programming/oop/object-oriented-programming/#overriding-a-method","title":"Overriding a Method","text":"<p>If the superclass and the subclass have a method named the same, the subclass overrides the superclass and the computer uses the subclass's method and not the superclass's.</p> <pre><code>// Pseudocode\nPublic Class Employee\n    Private Integer salary\n\n    //no-arg constructor\n    Public Method Employee ()\n        salary = 0\n    End Method\n\n    //constructor with an argument\n    //The \u201cthis.\u201d Is used to set the instance variable\n    Public Method Employee (String salary)\n        this.salary = salary\n    End Method\n\n    Public Method setSalary (Integer newSalary)\n        salary = newSalary\n    End Method\n\n    Public Method updateSalary (Integer increment) //overridden!\n        salary = salary + increment * 2\n    End Method\nEnd Class\n</code></pre> <pre><code>// Pseudocode\nPublic Class SalariedEmployee extends Employee\n    Public Method Employee ()\n        //no code.

So the <code>Student</code> class uses both its own <code>getFullName()</code> method and the superclass\u2019s. The <code>Student</code> class adds the student ID to the full name.</p> <p>Now, let\u2019s create a basic Driver Program that will create 2 person objects and 2 student objects:</p> <pre><code>// Pseudocode\nPublic Class PersonDriver\n    Public Module Main()\n        //Create the first person object p1\n        Person p1 = New Person(\n            getString(\"Enter the first name\"),\n            getString(\"Enter the last name\"))\n\n        //Create the second person object p2\n        // using a no-arg constructor\n        Person p2 = New Person()\n\n        //Use setters to set data for p2\n        p2.setFirstName(getString(\"Enter the first name\"))\n        p2.setLastName (getString(\"Enter the last name\"))\n\n        Display p1.getFullName() //Using a getter for p1\n        Display p2.getFullName() //Using a getter for p2\n\n        //Create the first student object s1\n        Student s1 = New Student(\n            getString(\"Enter the first name\"),\n            getString(\"Enter the last name\"),\n            getString(\"Enter the Student ID\"))\n\n        //Create the second student object s2\n        // using a no-arg constructor\n        Student s2 = New Student()\n\n        //Use setters to set the data for s2\n        s2.setFirstName (getString(\"Enter the first name\"))\n        s2.setLastName (getString(\"Enter the last name\"))\n        s2.setStudentID (getString(\"Enter the Student ID\"))\n\n        Display s1.getFullName() //Using a getter for s1\n        Display s2.getFullName() //Using a getter for s2\n\n    End Module\nEnd Class\n</code></pre> <p>The above code is all well and good if we have only a few objects to create, but it would become unwieldy if we had hundreds or thousands of objects. How can we organize this better?</p> <p>With an Array!

As a beginner to C, I'm finding it really difficult to pick up the language from just reading about the syntax rules. Are there any good resources / books / youtube videos to not only learn the syntax, but also the more advanced concepts (pointers, scope, etc)?</p> <p>Edit: I know learning how to code takes time, but I'd prefer resources that wouldn't be so time consuming. More of a resource that I could approach when I'm stuck on a single topic</p> <p>I've posted this here before and it's what has worked for me an a few others who told me it worked for them as well. Ymmv.</p> <p>People sometimes struggle with C when they start from scratch or come from a higher to lower level of abstraction. I struggled with this for a long time till I did these things:</p> <p>I would not try and understand how the higher level abstractions translate to the lower C level. I would instead learn from first principles on how a computer works and build the abstractions up from there. You will learn how a CPU works. How the data bus and registers are used. How memory is laid out and accessed. The call stack and how that works, etc.. This will go a long way in understanding how C sits on top of this and how it's data structures like arrays and structs map to this and understanding how pointers work the way they do and why. Check out these resources:</p> <pre><code>Read [Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software](http://charlespetzold.com/code)\n\nWatch [Exploring How Computers Work](https://youtu.be/QZwneRb-zqA)\n\nWatch all 41 videos of [A Crash Course in Computer Science](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8dPuuaLjXtNlUrzyH5r6jN9ulIgZBpdo)\n\nTake the [Build a Modern Computer from First Principles: From Nand to Tetris (Project-Centered Course)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer)\n\nTake the [CS50: Introduction to Computer Science](https://online-learning.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science) course.\n\nGrab a copy of[ C programming: A Modern Approach](http://knking.com/books/c2/index.html) and use it as your main course on C.\n\nFollow this [Tutorial On Pointers And Arrays In C](https://github.com/jflaherty/ptrtut13)\n</code></pre> <p>The first four really help by approaching C from a lower level of abstraction (actually the absolute lowest level and gradually adding layers of abstraction until you are at the C level which, by then is incredibly high!) You can do all four or pick one or two and dive deep. The 5<sup>th</sup> is a great introduction to computer science with a decent amount of C programming. The sixth is just the best tutorial on C. By far. The seventh is a deep dive into pointers and one of best tutorial on pointers and arrays out there (caveat, it's a little loose with the l-value/r-value definition for simplicity sake I believe.)</p> <p> https://github.com/practical-tutorials/project-based-learning#cc</p> <p>Play the long game when learning to code.</p> <p>You can also check out Teach Yourself Computer Science</p> <p>Here is a decent list of 8 Books on Algorithms and Data Structures For All Levels </p> <p>I agree with this. Nand2Tetris is especially very good for foundational knowledge. I also recommend reading Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective. You can also watch the video lectures from the authors of CS:APP : https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/academic/class/15213-f15/www/</p> <p>Started learning mid-summer last year and would recommend using more than one tool to learn, and make one of those a book. Here is a video series I came across that was clearly presented and easy to follow:</p> <p>https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBlnK6fEyqRhX6r2uhhlubuF5QextdCSM .</p> <p>Also, I think you will find some useful info in some of these post.

Always type the code in your own editor. This helps you build knowledge of syntax and constructs. </p> <p>This online book helped me more than anything else:</p> <p>https://beej.us/guide/bgc/</p> <p>I was scanning through the replies to see if anyone else had already mentioned this book. I've been using it as a supplement to one of my classes where we need to learn a bit of C, and have found the book to be incredibly clear and quite helpful. The writing style, which maintains an easygoing sort of tone, helps keep the material approachable.</p> <p>It may be worth noting that there are two volumes to the guide, a tutorial and a reference. I didn't see that right away, as the reference is only mentioned briefly in a link towards the top of the page, with the actual download being on the linked page. As someone new to C and programming in general, it's helpful to have a reference guide for common functions written in a relatively approachable language, as I can sometimes become a bit lost in the jargon of official documentation meant for a more professional audience.</p> <p>In fact, in a moment of procrastination, I was just looking at the Dedication section of the book. Beej specifically thanks the users of r/C_programming. Hence, my arrival in this sub a few minutes ago. Who knows, maybe Beej will see this post too.</p>","boost":1},{"location":"programming/ternary/","title":"Ternary - Index","text":"<ul> <li>Enhanced For Loops</li> <li>Enhanced If Statements</li> </ul>","boost":1},{"location":"programming/ternary/ternary-enhanced-for-loops-short-form-for-loops-examples/","title":"Enhanced For Loops","text":"<p>The usual way to step through all the elements of an array in order is with a \"standard\" for loop, for example,</p> <pre><code>for (int i = 0; i &lt; myArray.length; i++) {\n    System.out.println(myArray[i]);\n}\n</code></pre> <p>The so-called enhanced for loop is a simpler way to do this same thing.
