The shaft or spindle of a stepper motor rotates in discrete step increments when electrical command pulses are applied to it in the proper sequence. The motors rotation has several direct relationships to these applied input pulses. The sequence of the applied pulses is directly related to the direction of motor shafts rotation. The speed of the motor shafts rotation is directly related to the frequency of the input pulses and the length of rotation is directly related to the number of input pulses applied. One of the most significant advantages of a stepper motor is its ability to be accurately controlled in an open loop system. Open loop control means no feedback information about position is needed. This type of control eliminates the need for expensive sensing and feedback devices such as optical encoders.

Unlike unipolar steppers, bipolar steppers have no common center connection. They have two independent sets of coils instead. You can distinguish them from unipolar steppers by measuring the resistance between the wires. You should find two pairs of wires with equal resistance. If you\u2019ve got the leads of your meter connected to two wires that are not connected (i.e. not attached to the same coil), you should see infinite resistance (or no continuity).</p>","boost":1},{"location":"arduino/labs/lab-5-collision-avoidance/#mb-v2-breadboard-power-supply-module","title":"MB-V2 Breadboard Power Supply Module","text":"<p>The small DC motor is likely to use more power than an UNO R3 board digital output can handle directly.

So the <code>Student</code> class uses both its own <code>getFullName()</code> method and the superclass\u2019s. The <code>Student</code> class adds the student ID to the full name.</p> <p>Now, let\u2019s create a basic Driver Program that will create 2 person objects and 2 student objects:</p> <pre><code>// Pseudocode\nPublic Class PersonDriver\n    Public Module Main()\n        //Create the first person object p1\n        Person p1 = New Person(\n            getString(\"Enter the first name\"),\n            getString(\"Enter the last name\"))\n\n        //Create the second person object p2\n        // using a no-arg constructor\n        Person p2 = New Person()\n\n        //Use setters to set data for p2\n        p2.setFirstName(getString(\"Enter the first name\"))\n        p2.setLastName (getString(\"Enter the last name\"))\n\n        Display p1.getFullName() //Using a getter for p1\n        Display p2.getFullName() //Using a getter for p2\n\n        //Create the first student object s1\n        Student s1 = New Student(\n            getString(\"Enter the first name\"),\n            getString(\"Enter the last name\"),\n            getString(\"Enter the Student ID\"))\n\n        //Create the second student object s2\n        // using a no-arg constructor\n        Student s2 = New Student()\n\n        //Use setters to set the data for s2\n        s2.setFirstName (getString(\"Enter the first name\"))\n        s2.setLastName (getString(\"Enter the last name\"))\n        s2.setStudentID (getString(\"Enter the Student ID\"))\n\n        Display s1.getFullName() //Using a getter for s1\n        Display s2.getFullName() //Using a getter for s2\n\n    End Module\nEnd Class\n</code></pre> <p>The above code is all well and good if we have only a few objects to create, but it would become unwieldy if we had hundreds or thousands of objects. How can we organize this better?</p> <p>With an Array! (But you knew that.)</p> <pre><code>// Pseudocode\nProgram: PersonDriverWithAnArray\n\n    Private Person [] people = New Person[4];   //Global array\n\n    Public Module main()\n\n        //Create the objects in a loop\n        Declare Integer i\n\n        for i = 0 to 1 Step 1 //There are 2 person objects\n            people[i] = New Person()\n\n            Display \"Person #\", i\n            //Create the person\u2019s fields using setters\n            people[i].setFirstName(getString(\"First name?\"))\n            people[i].setLastName(getString(\"Last name?\"))\n        End For\n\n        for j = 2 to 3 Step 1 //There are 2 Student objects\n            people[i] = New Student()\n\n            Display \"Student #\", i\n            //Create the student\u2019s fields using setters\n            people[i].setFirstName(getString(\"First name?\"))\n        people[i].setLastName(getString(\"Last name?\"))\n        End For\n\n        Display \" \"\n\n        //Print all the full names in a loop using a getter\n        for i = 0 to people.length \u2013 1 Step 1\n            Display people[i].getFullName()\n        End For\n\n        //Illustrate polymorphism\n        for i = 0 to people.length \u2013 1 Step 1\n            displayInfo(people[i])\n        End For\n    End of Module\n\n    // Note the below module accepts Person objects\n    // but it will also accept any object that\n    // inherits from Person such as Student: Polymorphism!\n    Public Module displayInfo(Person p)\n        Display p.getFullName()\n    End Module\n\nEnd of Program\n</code></pre> <p>Polymorphism. One of my favorite words. Notice above that the <code>displayInfo(...)</code> method takes in a Person as a parameter. But the program is sending to it both Person and Student objects. Because Student extends Person the computer will know what to do with each type of object. That\u2019s polymorphism!</p> <p>For the above example to work, the method <code>getFullName()</code> must exist in the superclass as well as in the subclasses.</p>","boost":1},{"location":"programming/oop/object-oriented-programming/#can-you-do-this","title":"Can You Do This?","text":"<p>From your knowledge of OOP concepts and principles, write the below classes and the driver program.</p> <p></p> <p>Fly extends Insect.</p> <p>Specifications for the InsectDriver Program:</p> <ol> <li>Create the first Insect object using the constructor with all the parameters</li> <li>Create the second Insect object using the no-arg constructor</li> <li>Set the fields of the second Insect object using setters</li> <li>Display the fields of each Insect.</li> <li>Create the first Fly object using the constructor with all the parameters</li> <li>Create the second Fly object using the no-arg constructor</li> <li>Set the fields of the second Fly object using setters.</li> <li>Display the fields of each fly.</li> </ol>","boost":1},{"location":"programming/oop/oop-review-questions/","title":"Object-Oriented Programming Review Questions","text":"<p>You should be able to answer these questions, discuss their meaning, and give examples.
